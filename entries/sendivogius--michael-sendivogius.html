Sendivogius (Michael Sendivogius)</p>
<p>**Michael Sendivogius** (Michał Sędziwój, 1566-1636) was a Polish alchemist, natural philosopher, and courtier whose *Novum Lumen Chymicum* (New Chemical Light, 1604) became one of the most influential alchemical texts of the seventeenth century, widely read, translated, and commented upon throughout Europe. Educated in Kraków and Vienna, Sendivogius served various Central European nobles and rulers, claiming to possess alchemical secrets and reportedly performing successful transmutations before witnesses. The *Novum Lumen* presents alchemical theory in relatively clear language, discussing the "central salt of nature" or "aerial nitre" as the key to understanding both the generation of metals and the preparation of the Philosopher's Stone. Sendivogius argued that a universal spirit or aerial substance (associated with saltpeter) was the active principle in generation, growth, and transmutation, and that the alchemist's task was to capture and concentrate this spirit.</p>
<p>Sendivogius's theory of aerial nitre influenced later natural philosophers, including Robert Boyle, who cited Sendivogius in his own work on nitre and the "spring of the air." The idea that a substance in the air was essential for combustion, respiration, and other processes anticipated later discoveries about oxygen, though Sendivogius's theoretical framework remained firmly alchemical. The *Novum Lumen* was accompanied by the *Tractatus de Sulphure* (Treatise on Sulfur, actually written by an unknown author but published with Sendivogius's work), which discussed the philosophical sulfur and mercury and their role in the alchemical work. Together, these texts presented a coherent alchemical philosophy that combined traditional sulfur-mercury theory with Sendivogius's emphasis on aerial nitre.</p>
<p>Sendivogius's life combined alchemical practice, courtly service, and dramatic adventures, including his reported rescue of the Scottish alchemist Alexander Seton from prison and his acquisition of Seton's alchemical secrets. His reputation as a successful alchemist who had achieved transmutation made him a legendary figure, while his theoretical writings influenced both alchemical practitioners and natural philosophers interested in the principles of chemical change. Modern scholarship has examined Sendivogius's contributions to early modern chemistry and natural philosophy, recognizing his influence on the development of theories about aerial substances and chemical principles. Michael Sendivogius thus represents the early seventeenth-century alchemist as both practitioner and theorist, combining claims to practical success with systematic natural philosophical speculation that influenced the emerging science of chemistry.</p>
