# Report: Analytical Study of 'Laboratories of Art'

## 1. Study Subject
**Volume**: *Laboratories of Art: Alchemy and Art Technology from Antiquity to the 18th Century* (Edited by Sven Dupré, 2014).

## 2. Methodology Learnings
Our mining of the introduction and early chapters reveals several key "epistemic exchanges" that redefine our project goals:

- **Spatial Ambiguity**: The line between an "artisanal workshop" and an "alchemical laboratory" was historically porous. Adriaen van Utrecht’s *Allegory of Fire* (1636) serves as a visual index for this, showing a man working at a stove surrounded by equipment usable for both assaying and metallurgy.
- **The 'Arts of Fire'**: Following Vannoccio Biringuccio, alchemy was traditionally grouped with other pyro-technologies (glassmaking, porcelain, metallurgy). This suggests our database should treat "Alchemy" as an umbrella for material transformation rather than a hermetic silo.
- **Material Provenance**: Painters like Van Eyck were described as alchemists not because they were mystics, but because they were **agents of material transformation** (e.g., experimenting with oil binders and pigments).

## 3. Study Details: The Uffizi & Casino di San Marco
The volume highlights the Medici family's institutional integration of these arts:
- **The Fonderia (Uffizi)**: A court-sponsored hybrid lab where pharmacy, metallurgy, and art converged.
- **Thermal Analysis**: Contributors like Lawrence Principe show that techniques like "thermal analysis" (controlled heating) were the shared rigorous language between porcelain producers (John Dwight, Böttger) and alchemists.

## 4. Synthesis for AlchemyDB
Based on this study, we have integrated 21 new entries into the Lexicon, specifically focusing on the **Technics of Transformation**:
- **Porphyropoeia**: The art of purple dyeing.
- **Argyropoeia**: The whitening of metals.
- **Thermal Testing**: The use of fire as an analytical tool.

**Lesson for the Project Log:** 
Instead of tracking "mysticism," we are now tracking "Material Capital." The dashboard must reflect that alchemical success was often measured by the quality of a clear glass or the purity of a metallic alloy.
