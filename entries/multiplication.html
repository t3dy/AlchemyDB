Multiplication</p>
<p>**Multiplication** is the operation of increasing the quantity and power of the Philosopher's Stone by subjecting it to repeated cycles of dissolution and coagulation. According to alchemical theory, the Stone could be multiplied both in quantity (producing more Stone from a small amount) and in quality (increasing its power to transmute larger quantities of base metal). Multiplication was performed by dissolving the perfected Stone in the philosophical mercury, then repeating the operations of the work (conjunction, putrefaction, distillation, coagulation) with this mixture. Each cycle of multiplication was believed to increase the Stone's power tenfold or more.</p>
<p>The multiplication operation involved taking the perfected Stone and dissolving it in fresh philosophical mercury or in its own spirit. This mixture was then subjected to the same operations that had produced the Stone originally, but the process was much faster because the Stone acted as a ferment, accelerating the transformation. After completing the cycle, the resulting Stone would be more powerful than before: if the original Stone could transmute 100 parts of base metal, the multiplied Stone might transmute 1000 parts. The operation could be repeated multiple times, with each multiplication increasing the Stone's power. Some texts describe seven or more multiplications, each increasing the power by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, multiplication represented the infinite potential of the perfected work, the principle that perfection could generate more perfection, and the idea that the Stone contained within itself the power of endless generation. Multiplication demonstrated that the Stone was not merely a chemical reagent that was consumed in use, but a true philosophical substance that could reproduce and multiply itself. The operation was associated with themes of abundance, fertility, and infinite generation. Multiplication represented the final perfection of the Stone, transforming it from a substance capable of limited transmutation to one capable of transmuting unlimited quantities of base metal. Multiplication thus represents both the practical operation of increasing the Stone's quantity and power, and the symbolic operation of manifesting the infinite generative potential of perfected matter.</p>
