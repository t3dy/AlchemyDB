Arnald of Villanova</p>
<p>**Arnald of Villanova** (c. 1240-1311) was a Catalan physician, theologian, and natural philosopher whose medical writings and religious prophecies made him one of the most controversial intellectuals of his age, and to whom numerous alchemical and iatrochemical texts were falsely attributed in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The historical Arnald was a learned physician who taught at Montpellier, served as physician to kings and popes, and wrote extensively on medicine, including works on regimen, pharmacology, and the preparation of medicines. His authentic medical works show sophisticated knowledge of Galenic medicine, Arabic medical learning, and the use of distilled spirits and chemical preparations in pharmacy. However, there is no convincing evidence that the historical Arnald practiced alchemy or wrote alchemical treatises.</p>
<p>The alchemical corpus attributed to Arnald includes important texts such as the *Rosarium philosophorum* (Rosary of the Philosophers), the *Novum lumen* (New Light), and the *Flos florum* (Flower of Flowers), which circulated widely in manuscript and print. These works discuss the theory and practice of making the Philosopher's Stone, the preparation of alchemical medicines, and the relationship between alchemy and medicine. The *Rosarium*, one of the most influential alchemical texts of the late Middle Ages, presents the alchemical process through a series of symbolic images (later elaborated in the illustrated *Rosarium* editions) and discusses the generation of metals, the nature of the Stone, and the operations required to produce it. The attribution of these texts to Arnald gave them authority and linked alchemical knowledge to one of the most respected medical authorities of the age.</p>
<p>Modern scholarship, particularly the work of Michela Pereira and others, has carefully distinguished Arnald's authentic medical writings from the spurious alchemical corpus, while also examining why Arnald became such an attractive figure for alchemical attribution. His genuine interest in distillation and chemical pharmacy, his reputation for medical learning, and perhaps his controversial status as a religious prophet made him a suitable candidate for posthumous transformation into an alchemical authority. The pseudo-Arnaldian alchemical texts represent an important strand of late medieval alchemy that emphasized the medical applications of the art and the connections between alchemical and pharmaceutical knowledge. Arnald of Villanova thus exemplifies the complex processes by which medieval medical authorities became associated with alchemy through pseudonymous attribution, and how alchemical literature created its own genealogy of authoritative practitioners.</p>
