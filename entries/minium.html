<p>**Minium** (red lead, lead tetroxide, Pb₃O₄; also called *red lead* or *Saturn's red*) is a bright orange-red pigment produced by heating white lead (lead carbonate) or litharge (lead oxide) in air. Known since antiquity and described by Pliny the Elder, minium was used extensively in manuscript illumination, painting, and as a protective coating for metal. The name "minium" (from Latin *minium*, possibly derived from the Minius River in Spain where cinnabar was mined) was sometimes confused with cinnabar (mercury sulfide), another red pigment, but by the medieval period the distinction was generally clear. The preparation of minium was described in numerous technical texts: lead or litharge was heated in a reverberatory furnace with careful control of air flow, producing the characteristic orange-red powder.</p>
<p>In alchemy, minium was significant both as a lead compound and as a substance that demonstrated the transformation of metals through fire. The color change from white or yellow to red was interpreted as a kind of perfection or maturation, analogous to the reddening (rubedo) of the final stage of the Great Work. Some alchemists used minium in attempts to extract the "philosophical mercury" from lead or to prepare lead for transmutation. In medicine, minium was used externally in plasters and ointments, though its toxicity (like that of all lead compounds) was increasingly recognized in the early modern period. The substance's bright color and its association with lead (Saturn) gave it symbolic significance in alchemical allegory.</p>
<p>Modern chemistry recognizes minium as lead tetroxide (Pb₃O₄), formed by the oxidation of lead or lead monoxide at temperatures around 450-480°C. The substance is indeed toxic, and its use in paints and other applications has been largely discontinued due to health concerns. Nevertheless, the historical production and use of minium represented sophisticated empirical knowledge of oxidation processes and temperature control. The substance's role in both art and alchemy exemplifies the interconnections between aesthetic, technical, and philosophical domains in pre-modern material culture. Minium thus stands as both a practical pigment and a symbolic substance, embodying the alchemical fascination with color transformations and the belief that the reddening of matter signified its approach to perfection.</p>
