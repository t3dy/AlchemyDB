Joseph Duchesne (Quercetanus)</p>
<p>**Joseph Duchesne** (c. 1544–1609), known by his Latinized name **Quercetanus**, was a French physician and alchemist who served as physician to King Henry IV of France. He was a prominent defender of Paracelsian medicine and a key figure in the controversy between chemical and Galenic physicians in late sixteenth-century France. His works, particularly *De Priscorum Philosophorum Materia* (1603) and *Pharmacopoeia Dogmaticorum* (1607), presented systematic defenses of chemical medicine and detailed descriptions of spagyric preparations. Duchesne's position at the French court gave Paracelsian medicine significant legitimacy and helped establish iatrochemistry in France.</p>
<p>Duchesne studied medicine at the University of Basel and became convinced of the superiority of Paracelsian chemical medicine over traditional Galenic practice. He established a medical practice in Paris and became embroiled in the fierce controversy between the Faculty of Medicine (which defended Galenic orthodoxy) and the chemical physicians. Duchesne's works defended the use of antimony, mercury, and other chemical remedies, arguing that properly prepared chemical medicines were safer and more effective than traditional herbal remedies. He emphasized the importance of spagyric separation—the alchemical process of separating, purifying, and recombining the essential principles of substances—in preparing medicines.</p>
<p>Duchesne's significance lies in his role in legitimizing Paracelsian medicine at the highest levels of French society. His position as royal physician demonstrated that chemical medicine was not merely the practice of marginal figures but could be embraced by the medical establishment. His systematic presentations of chemical pharmacy helped make Paracelsian medicine more accessible and acceptable to conventional physicians. Duchesne also contributed to alchemical theory, arguing that the alchemical understanding of matter—based on the three principles of mercury, sulfur, and salt—was superior to the Aristotelian theory of four elements. His work represents the integration of Paracelsian medicine into mainstream European medical practice.</p>
