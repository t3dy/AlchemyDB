Resin</p>
<p>**Resin** (Lat. *resina*) refers to various sticky, aromatic substances exuded from trees and plants, used in alchemy, medicine, and various crafts. Different resins had different properties and uses: frankincense and myrrh were burned as incense and used in medicine, pine resin was used in adhesives and varnishes, dragon's blood (from *Dracaena* trees) was used as a red pigment and in medicine, and various other resins served as components in pharmaceutical preparations and alchemical operations. In alchemy, resins were used in fumigations, in the preparation of varnishes and protective coatings, and as components in certain medicines and tinctures.</p>
<p>The aromatic properties of many resins—their pleasant smell when burned—associated them with purification, sanctification, and the volatile or spiritual aspects of matter. Frankincense and myrrh, mentioned in biblical and classical texts, were among the most precious substances in the ancient and medieval world, valued for their use in religious ceremonies and in medicine. In alchemical symbolism, resins represented the "soul" or combustible principle of plants, analogous to the sulfurous principle in minerals. The distillation of resins to extract their essential oils or spirits was practiced by both alchemists and pharmaceutical chemists, producing aromatic oils used in perfumery and medicine.</p>
<p>Modern chemistry recognizes resins as complex mixtures of terpenoids, phenolic compounds, and other organic substances, which explains their aromatic properties and their ability to form protective coatings when dried. The historical uses of resins in medicine, perfumery, and various crafts reflect empirical knowledge of their properties, even without understanding their chemical composition. The substances' aromatic qualities, their association with precious trade goods, and their role in religious ceremonies gave them symbolic significance that extended beyond their practical applications. Resins thus represent how natural products from distant lands were incorporated into European alchemy and pharmacy, carrying with them associations of exoticism, sanctity, and the power to purify and transform.</p>
