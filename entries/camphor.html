Camphor</p>
<p>**Camphor** (Lat. *camphora*; from Arabic *kāfūr*) is a white, crystalline, aromatic substance obtained from the camphor tree (*Cinnamomum camphora*) native to East Asia, or produced synthetically from turpentine. Known in Europe from medieval times through Arab trade, camphor was highly valued in medicine and pharmacy for its aromatic, stimulant, and preservative properties. In medicine, camphor was used as a stimulant, as a treatment for various ailments, and as a component in ointments and liniments. Its strong, penetrating odor and its ability to sublime (transform directly from solid to vapor when heated) made it seem like a quintessentially volatile or "spiritual" substance.</p>
<p>In alchemy and pharmaceutical chemistry, camphor's volatility and its aromatic properties associated it with the mercurial or spiritual principle. Some alchemical texts mention camphor in recipes for preparing quintessences or in operations involving volatile substances. The substance's ability to sublime made it useful for demonstrating the separation of volatile from fixed principles, a fundamental alchemical operation. Camphor was also used in the preparation of various medicines, particularly those intended to stimulate or revive, and in fumigations for purification or preservation.</p>
<p>Modern chemistry recognizes camphor as a terpenoid ketone (C₁₀H₁₆O) that indeed sublimes readily at room temperature, explaining its characteristic odor and its traditional uses. The substance has mild analgesic and antimicrobial properties, providing some basis for its medical applications. Camphor's journey from East Asian forests to European laboratories exemplifies the global trade in natural products and the incorporation of exotic substances into Western medicine and alchemy. The substance's aromatic, volatile nature and its association with stimulation and preservation made it symbolically significant, representing the volatile, active, spiritual aspects of matter. Camphor thus embodies the intersection of long-distance trade, pharmaceutical practice, and alchemical symbolism, a precious substance whose properties seemed to confirm theories about the volatile principles hidden within matter.</p>
