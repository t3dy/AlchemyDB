Hermes Trismegistus</p>
<p>**Hermes Trismegistus** (Thrice-Great Hermes) is the legendary author of the Hermetic corpus, a collection of Greek philosophical and religious texts composed in the early centuries CE but believed in the Renaissance to be the work of an ancient Egyptian sage contemporary with or predating Moses. The Hermetic writings include the *Corpus Hermeticum* (philosophical dialogues on cosmology, theology, and the nature of humanity), the *Asclepius* (a dialogue on Egyptian religion and magic), and various technical texts on astrology, alchemy, and magic. The alchemical Hermetica, particularly texts like the *Emerald Tablet* (Tabula Smaragdina), attributed to Hermes the fundamental principles of alchemy and established him as the legendary founder of the art. The *Emerald Tablet*, with its famous dictum "As above, so below," became the most concise and influential statement of alchemical philosophy, endlessly commented upon and incorporated into alchemical texts.</p>
<p>The Renaissance recovery and translation of the Hermetic corpus, particularly Marsilio Ficino's 1463 Latin translation of the *Corpus Hermeticum*, created enormous excitement among humanist scholars and natural philosophers. The texts seemed to preserve ancient Egyptian wisdom that anticipated Christian revelation and provided a philosophical foundation for magic, astrology, and alchemy. Hermes Trismegistus was identified with the Egyptian god Thoth and was believed to have taught Pythagoras, Plato, and other Greek philosophers, making him the source of a prisca theologia (ancient theology) that underlay all wisdom traditions. Alchemists cited Hermes as the founder of their art and interpreted the *Emerald Tablet* as containing the secret of the Philosopher's Stone in cryptic form.</p>
<p>The chronology of the Hermetic texts was definitively overturned by Isaac Casaubon in 1614, who demonstrated through philological analysis that they were composed in the early Christian era, not in ancient Egypt. Nevertheless, Hermetic ideas continued to influence alchemy, natural philosophy, and esotericism into the modern period. Modern scholarship has examined the Hermetic texts in their Greco-Egyptian context, recognizing them as products of the religious and philosophical ferment of late antiquity rather than as repositories of ancient Egyptian wisdom. The figure of Hermes Trismegistus and the texts attributed to him represent the power of legendary authorship to shape intellectual traditions, and the ways in which alchemy grounded its authority in claims to ancient wisdom. Hermes thus stands as the mythical founder of alchemy, the legendary sage whose cryptic utterances inspired centuries of interpretation and practice.</p>
