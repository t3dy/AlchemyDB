Marcasite</p>
<p>**Marcasite** (iron disulfide, FeS₂; also called *white pyrite* or *white marcasite*) is a pale bronze or silvery mineral chemically identical to pyrite but with a different crystal structure. Medieval and early modern texts used "marcasite" more broadly to refer to various metallic sulfides and arsenides, creating considerable confusion in the historical literature. In alchemical theory, marcasites were understood as immature or imperfect metals, substances that contained metallic principles but had not yet achieved full metallic form. The *Summa Perfectionis* and other Geberian texts discuss marcasites as intermediate substances in the generation of metals, formed when sulphurous and mercurial vapors combined in the earth but failed to achieve perfect balance.</p>
<p>The practical importance of marcasites lay in their role in metallurgy and in the production of sulfuric acid. When roasted (heated in air), marcasites released sulfurous fumes that could be condensed and oxidized to produce oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid). Various marcasites were also sources of metals: arsenical marcasites (actually arsenopyrite, FeAsS) were sources of arsenic, while other sulfide minerals yielded copper, lead, or other metals when smelted. Alchemists experimented with marcasites in attempts to extract their metallic principles or to use them as intermediates in transmutational processes. The substances' metallic luster and their transformation when heated seemed to confirm alchemical theories about the generation and perfection of metals.</p>
<p>Modern mineralogy distinguishes marcasite (orthorhombic FeS₂) from pyrite (cubic FeS₂), though they are chemically identical polymorphs. The historical confusion about "marcasites" reflects the difficulty of distinguishing minerals based on appearance alone, without modern analytical techniques. Nevertheless, the empirical knowledge that various sulfide minerals could yield metals when roasted or smelted was genuine metallurgical insight. William Newman's research has shown how alchemical theories about marcasites as immature metals influenced early modern mineralogy and metallurgy, contributing to developing understanding of ore formation and metal extraction. The term thus represents both a specific mineral and a broader category of metallic sulfides, embodying the challenges of classification and identification that characterized pre-modern mineralogy.</p>
