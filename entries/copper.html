<p>**Copper** (Lat. *cuprum* or *aes*; alchemical symbol ♀) is the metal of Venus, associated with femininity, beauty, and the color green. In alchemical matter theory, copper was understood as an imperfect metal suffering from an excess of impure, combustible Sulphur, which gave it its reddish color and made it susceptible to corrosion, forming green patinas (verdigris) when exposed to air and moisture. The *Summa Perfectionis* describes copper as closer to perfection than lead or tin but still requiring purification and transmutation to achieve the nobility of silver or gold. The metal's association with Venus extended beyond astrological correspondence: copper's beauty, its warm color, and its use in mirrors and ornaments linked it symbolically with the goddess of love and beauty.</p>
<p>Copper and its compounds played crucial roles in alchemical practice. Verdigris (copper acetate), produced by exposing copper to vinegar fumes, was used as a pigment, a mordant in dyeing, and a component in various medicinal and alchemical preparations. Blue vitriol (copper sulfate) was employed in dyeing, in the preparation of pigments, and in alchemical operations. The cementation of copper—treating it with various substances to change its color or properties—was a common experimental procedure, with some practitioners claiming to have "whitened" copper into silver or "reddened" it into gold through such processes. The *Leyden Papyrus* and other early technical texts describe recipes for creating gold-colored copper alloys, techniques that later alchemists interpreted as evidence for genuine transmutation.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of "copper precipitation" or "cementation"—where iron immersed in copper sulfate solution becomes coated with metallic copper—was particularly significant for alchemical theory. This apparent transformation of iron into copper seemed to demonstrate that metals could indeed change their nature, providing empirical support for the possibility of transmutation. Modern chemistry explains this as a displacement reaction (Fe + CuSO₄ → FeSO₄ + Cu), not a true transmutation, but the visual evidence was compelling to pre-modern observers. Pamela Smith's research on artisanal knowledge has revealed the sophistication of early modern copper metallurgy, including techniques for refining, alloying, and working copper that were developed partly through alchemical experimentation. The metal's symbolic associations—with Venus, with the green of vegetation and growth, with feminine beauty and receptivity—made it central to alchemical allegory, where the "greening" (viriditas) of matter represented the first stirrings of life and the promise of transformation.</p>
