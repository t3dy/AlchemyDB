Distillation</p>
<p>**Distillation** is the operation of separating components of a mixture by heating to vaporize the more volatile components, then cooling to condense the vapors back to liquid form. Distillation was one of the most important and frequently used alchemical operations, employed to purify substances, to separate mixtures, to extract essences, and to prepare spirits, oils, and quintessences. The operation required specialized apparatus (cucurbit and alembic, retort, or other distillation vessels) and careful control of heat. Distillation could be simple (single distillation) or repeated multiple times (rectification) to achieve greater purity.</p>
<p>Alchemists used distillation for numerous purposes: preparing alcohol (aqua vitae) from wine, preparing acids (aqua fortis, aqua regia) from mineral mixtures, purifying mercury, extracting essential oils from plants, and separating the volatile from the fixed in various materials. The operation required understanding of the relationship between heat and volatility: different substances vaporize at different temperatures, allowing for separation based on this property. Fractional distillation, using specialized apparatus or multiple distillations, could separate components with similar volatilities. The distilled product (the distillate) was collected in a receiver, while the non-volatile residue (the caput mortuum or dead head) remained in the distillation vessel.</p>
<p>In alchemical philosophy, distillation represented the separation and elevation of the subtle from the gross, the ascent of spirit from body. The operation was often described in symbolic terms: the spirit or soul ascending from the body, the volatile mercury rising from the fixed sulfur, the eagle flying upward. The subsequent condensation represented the descent of purified spirit, the return of the soul to the body in perfected form. Distillation was associated with the element of air (the vaporous state), with upward movement and ascent, and with purification through repeated cycles of vaporization and condensation. The maxim "ascendit a terra in coelum, iterumque descendit in terram" (it ascends from earth to heaven, and again descends to earth) from the Emerald Tablet was understood as describing distillation. Distillation thus represents both the practical operation of separating by volatility and the symbolic operation of purifying through ascent and descent.</p>
