George Ripley</p>
<p>**George Ripley** (c. 1415-1490) was an English Augustinian canon and alchemist whose works, particularly the *Compound of Alchymy* (1471), became foundational texts in the English alchemical tradition and influenced European alchemy through Latin translations. Educated at Cambridge and reportedly traveled to Italy, where he may have studied alchemy and met Pope Innocent VIII, Ripley returned to England and composed his major alchemical works in English verse and prose. The *Compound of Alchymy*, dedicated to King Edward IV, presents the alchemical process in twelve chapters or "Gates," each describing a stage of the work: Calcination, Solution, Separation, Conjunction, Putrefaction, Congelation, Cibation, Sublimation, Fermentation, Exaltation, Multiplication, and Projection. Written in rhyming verse, the *Compound* combines practical instructions with allegorical imagery and moral exhortation, creating a work that was both a technical manual and a spiritual guide.</p>
<p>Ripley's other works include the *Medulla* (Marrow of Alchemy), various epistles and treatises, and commentaries on earlier alchemical texts. His writings emphasize the importance of understanding alchemical theory before attempting practice, the need for patience and divine grace, and the moral and spiritual preparation required of the alchemist. The famous "Ripley Scrolls"—large illuminated manuscripts depicting the alchemical process through elaborate symbolic imagery—were attributed to him, though their exact relationship to Ripley's authentic works is uncertain. These scrolls, with their vivid depictions of dragons, birds, vessels, and human figures, became iconic images of English alchemy and were copied and adapted throughout the early modern period.</p>
<p>Ripley's influence on English alchemy was profound and long-lasting. His works were studied by Elizabethan alchemists including John Dee, were cited by seventeenth-century writers like Elias Ashmole (who published Ripley's works in the *Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum*, 1652), and continued to be read and copied into the eighteenth century. The *Compound of Alchymy* provided a systematic framework for understanding the alchemical process that was more accessible than many Continental Latin texts, while its English verse made it memorable and quotable. Modern scholarship has recognized Ripley as a significant figure in the vernacularization of alchemy and in the development of a distinctively English alchemical tradition. George Ripley thus represents the medieval English alchemical tradition at its most systematic and influential, bridging scholastic learning and vernacular practice.</p>
