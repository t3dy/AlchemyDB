Gold</p>
<p>**Gold** (Lat. *aurum*; alchemical symbol ☉) is the supreme metal in alchemical cosmology, representing perfection, incorruptibility, and the ultimate goal of chrysopoeia (gold-making). Unlike other metals, gold does not tarnish, corrode, or oxidize under normal conditions, a property that medieval natural philosophers interpreted as evidence of its perfect internal balance of Sulphur and Mercury. In the Aristotelian-Galenic tradition transmitted through Arabic alchemy, gold was associated with the sun, with warmth and dryness in the second degree, and with the heart in medical correspondences. The *Summa Perfectionis* and other Geberian texts describe gold as the standard against which all other metals are measured: it possesses the ideal proportion of fixed, pure Sulphur and volatile, pure Mercury, making it resistant to fire and immune to the corrosive action of acids (except aqua regia, the "royal water" specifically designed to dissolve the "king of metals").</p>
<p>The alchemical quest to transmute base metals into gold was not merely motivated by greed but by a sophisticated theory of metallic generation and perfection. Medieval alchemists, following Arabic sources like Jabir ibn Hayyan and al-Razi, believed that all metals shared a common matter and differed only in the purity and proportion of their constituent principles. Lead, tin, copper, and iron were understood as "sick" or "immature" metals, suffering from impurities or imbalances that prevented them from achieving gold's perfection. The alchemist's task was therefore therapeutic: to remove these impurities, correct the imbalances, and guide the base metal toward its natural telos—the perfection embodied in gold. This was to be accomplished through the Philosopher's Stone, a medicine for metals that could effect in moments what nature required millennia to achieve in the earth's womb.</p>
<p>Modern chemistry has revealed both the insights and limitations of alchemical gold theory. Gold is indeed an element (Au, atomic number 79), and its chemical stability results from its electronic configuration, which makes it highly resistant to oxidation and corrosion. The alchemical intuition that metals share common constituents was not entirely wrong—all metals are composed of atoms—but the specific transformation of one element into another requires nuclear reactions, not chemical processes. Nevertheless, the intensive study of gold and its properties contributed significantly to the development of metallurgy, assaying techniques, and analytical chemistry. Pamela Smith's research on artisanal knowledge has shown how alchemical work with gold informed practices of gilding, refining, and testing precious metals. The symbolic dimension of gold—representing spiritual perfection, divine light, and the incorruptible soul—made it central to alchemical allegory, where the production of physical gold was often read as a metaphor for the purification and perfection of the human spirit.</p>
