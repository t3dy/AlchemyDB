Thomas Vaughan</p>
<p>**Thomas Vaughan** (1621-1666) was a Welsh clergyman, alchemist, and Hermetic philosopher who wrote under the pseudonym "Eugenius Philalethes" (not to be confused with Eirenaeus Philalethes/George Starkey), producing works that combined Hermetic philosophy, Rosicrucian ideals, and alchemical theory. Educated at Oxford and ordained as an Anglican priest, Vaughan lost his living during the English Civil War and devoted himself to alchemical and philosophical studies. His major works include *Anthroposophia Theomagica* (1650), *Anima Magica Abscondita* (The Hidden Magical Soul, 1650), *Magia Adamica* (Adamic Magic, 1650), and *Lumen de Lumine* (Light from Light, 1651), which present a Hermetic cosmology emphasizing the role of light, spirit, and the divine creative power in nature.</p>
<p>Vaughan's alchemical philosophy emphasized the importance of understanding the spiritual principles underlying material operations. He criticized "vulgar" alchemists who worked only with external materials without understanding the inner, spiritual dimensions of the art. His works discuss the "universal spirit" or "astral light" that pervades nature and that must be captured and concentrated in alchemical operations. Vaughan was influenced by Hermetic texts, Paracelsian philosophy, and Rosicrucian ideals, and he engaged in controversies with Henry More and other Cambridge Platonists who criticized his obscure style and his claims about occult knowledge.</p>
<p>Vaughan's twin brother, Henry Vaughan, was a celebrated metaphysical poet, and Thomas's own prose has a poetic, visionary quality. His alchemical writings emphasize mystical experience and spiritual illumination as essential to understanding nature's secrets. Modern scholarship, particularly the work of Alan Rudrum and Donald Dickson, has examined Vaughan's Hermetic philosophy and his place in seventeenth-century English intellectual life. Thomas Vaughan thus represents the Hermetic alchemist who emphasized the spiritual and visionary dimensions of the art, and who defended the reality of occult knowledge against both materialistic alchemists and rationalist critics.</p>
