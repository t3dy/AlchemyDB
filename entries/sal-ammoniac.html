Sal Ammoniac</p>
<p>**Sal ammoniac** (ammonium chloride, NH₄Cl; Lat. *sal ammoniacus*) is a white, crystalline salt that played a crucial role in medieval and early modern alchemy. Named after the Temple of Jupiter Ammon in Libya, near which it was originally collected from volcanic vents, sal ammoniac was classified as one of the "spirits"—volatile substances that sublime when heated, transforming directly from solid to vapor without melting. This property made it invaluable in alchemical operations, particularly in the sublimation and purification of other substances. Medieval Arabic alchemists, including Jabir ibn Hayyan and al-Razi, described sal ammoniac as essential for "opening" and "volatilizing" metals, allowing them to be manipulated and transformed.</p>
<p>The preparation of sal ammoniac from various sources—including soot from burning camel dung, urine, and later from the distillation of organic materials—was described in numerous alchemical texts. The *Liber de septuaginta* and other works attributed to Jabir provide detailed procedures for purifying sal ammoniac through repeated sublimations, producing a pure white crystalline substance. Sal ammoniac was used in combination with mercury, sulfur, and various metals in attempts to produce the Philosopher's Stone, and it played a key role in the preparation of aqua regia (royal water), the acid capable of dissolving gold. The substance's ability to facilitate the volatilization of metals—forming volatile metal chlorides—made it seem like a key to unlocking the fixed nature of metallic bodies.</p>
<p>In practical metallurgy, sal ammoniac was used as a flux in soldering and in the purification of metals. Its vapors could clean metal surfaces and facilitate the joining of metal parts, making it valuable in goldsmithing and other crafts. Modern chemistry understands sal ammoniac as ammonium chloride, which indeed sublimes when heated (decomposing into ammonia and hydrogen chloride gases, which recombine to form solid ammonium chloride on cool surfaces). William Newman's research has shown how medieval alchemists' work with sal ammoniac contributed to the development of sublimation techniques and to the understanding of volatile substances. The substance's role in "opening" metals—actually forming volatile metal chlorides—was a genuine chemical insight, even if the theoretical framework was pre-modern. Sal ammoniac thus represents both a practical reagent and a theoretical key, embodying the alchemical principle that volatilization and fixation are complementary operations in the transformation of matter.</p>
