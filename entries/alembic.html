<p>The **alembic** (from Arabic *al-anbīq*, derived from Greek *ambix*, "cup") is the quintessential apparatus of distillation, consisting of a cucurbit (the lower vessel containing the material to be distilled) and a head or cap with a descending spout through which vapors condense and flow into a receiving vessel. The design, transmitted from Hellenistic Egypt through Arabic alchemy to medieval Latin Europe, represents one of the most important technological innovations in the history of chemistry. The *Liber de septuaginta* (Book of Seventy), attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan, describes various forms of alembics and their uses in preparing quintessences, extracting spirits from wine, and purifying mineral substances. By the thirteenth century, European alchemists had developed sophisticated variations, including the "Moor's head" (*caput Mauri*) with its distinctive bulbous shape, and the "Rosenhut" (rose-head) alembic with multiple collection spouts.</p>
<p>The alembic's importance extended far beyond its practical function as a piece of laboratory equipment. In alchemical theory, distillation was understood as a process of purification and spiritualization: the volatile "spirit" of a substance was separated from its gross "body" through the action of fire, ascending as vapor and descending as purified liquid—a material enactment of the alchemical maxim "solve et coagula" (dissolve and coagulate). The *Rosarium Philosophorum* and other emblem books depict the alembic as a site of transformation, often showing the king and queen (representing Sulphur and Mercury) being dissolved, volatilized, and reunited within the vessel. The repeated distillations described in texts like Arnald of Villanova's *Rosarius* (c. 1330) were believed to progressively refine substances, removing impurities and concentrating their essential virtues until the quintessence or philosophical mercury was obtained.</p>
<p>Modern historians of science have recognized the alembic as a crucial instrument in the development of experimental chemistry. The systematic study of distillation led to the discovery of mineral acids (nitric, sulfuric, and hydrochloric), the preparation of concentrated alcohol (*aqua vitae*), and the isolation of essential oils from plants—all fundamental to the emergence of iatrochemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. William Newman's research has shown how medieval alchemists developed increasingly sophisticated distillation techniques, including fractional distillation and the use of water baths (*balneum Mariae*) to control temperature. The alembic thus represents both a practical tool and a symbolic vessel: the site where matter was transformed, where the volatile was separated from the fixed, and where the alchemist enacted in miniature the cosmic processes of generation, corruption, and regeneration.</p>
