Matras (Matrass)</p>
<p>**The matras** or matrass is a round-bottomed glass flask with a long neck, used for digestion, circulation, and gentle distillation. The vessel's shape—a spherical or egg-shaped body with a narrow neck—made it suitable for operations requiring prolonged gentle heating, as the rounded bottom distributed heat evenly and the narrow neck minimized evaporation while allowing for some vapor release. The matras appears frequently in alchemical texts and illustrations as the vessel for philosophical operations, often identified with the philosophical egg or the vessel of Hermes.</p>
<p>The matras was used for digestion (prolonged gentle heating to extract virtues or promote transformation), for circulation (when sealed and heated, materials would vaporize and condense repeatedly within the vessel), and for gentle distillation. The vessel could be sealed hermetically for operations requiring complete containment, or fitted with a stopper or alembic head for operations requiring some vapor release. Alchemists used the matras for preparing tinctures, for digesting the philosophical mercury, and for operations related to the Great Work. The vessel's egg-like shape resonated with alchemical symbolism of generation and birth.</p>
<p>The matras represents the philosophical vessel, the container in which the alchemical transformation occurs. Texts often describe the matras in symbolic terms: it is the womb in which the Stone is generated, the egg from which the philosophical bird hatches, the vessel of Hermes in which the elements are married. The matras's simple, elegant shape made it an ideal symbol of the alchemical vessel, and it appears in countless alchemical emblems and illustrations. The matras thus represents both a practical vessel for gentle heating and circulation, and the symbolic vessel of alchemical generation and transformation.</p>
