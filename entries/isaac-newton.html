Isaac Newton</p>
<p>**Isaac Newton** (1642-1727), celebrated as one of the greatest scientists in history for his work on mathematics, optics, and gravitation, was also a dedicated alchemist who spent decades conducting laboratory experiments and studying alchemical texts. Newton's alchemical manuscripts, comprising over a million words, remained largely unpublished and unstudied until the twentieth century, leading earlier biographers to dismiss this aspect of his work as an embarrassing aberration. However, modern scholarship, particularly the work of Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs, William Newman, and Lawrence Principe, has demonstrated that Newton's alchemy was integral to his natural philosophy, not separate from it. His alchemical studies informed his theories about matter, force, and the structure of the cosmos, providing a framework for understanding phenomena that mechanical philosophy alone could not explain—particularly the active principles, attractions, and repulsions that seemed to operate in chemical reactions and gravitational attraction.</p>
<p>Newton's alchemical laboratory at Trinity College, Cambridge, was the site of intensive experimental work from the 1670s through the 1690s. His notebooks record hundreds of experiments involving the heating, distillation, and combination of metals, minerals, and chemical reagents, following recipes from authors like George Starkey (writing as Eirenaeus Philalethes), Michael Sendivogius, and Michael Maier. Newton was particularly interested in the concept of the "net" (*rete*)—a sophic mercury or metallic solvent that could penetrate and transform other metals—and in the production of the "star regulus of antimony," a crystalline antimony preparation that he believed held the key to transmutation. His manuscript "Praxis," a detailed laboratory notebook, reveals the meticulous care with which he conducted these experiments, recording temperatures, times, colors, and results with the same precision he applied to his optical experiments.</p>
<p>Newton's alchemical reading was equally extensive. He compiled the *Index Chemicus*, a massive index of alchemical authors and concepts, and produced numerous translations and commentaries on alchemical texts, including multiple versions of the *Emerald Tablet*. His understanding of alchemy was sophisticated and selective: he rejected the mystical and religious allegories that some alchemists favored, focusing instead on texts that seemed to describe actual laboratory procedures and chemical transformations. Modern analysis has shown how Newton's alchemical concept of active principles—subtle, attractive forces operating between particles—influenced his formulation of universal gravitation and his speculations about the ether. The famous query 31 of the *Opticks* (1704), which discusses short-range attractive and repulsive forces between particles, draws directly on alchemical ideas about chemical affinity and the "sociability" of substances. Newton's alchemy thus represents not a contradiction to his scientific work but a complementary investigation into the active powers of nature, the hidden forces that animate matter and drive chemical and physical transformations—an investigation that, while it did not produce the Philosopher's Stone, contributed significantly to his revolutionary reconceptualization of the natural world.</p>
