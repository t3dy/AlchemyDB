Maier's Symbola Aureae Mensae</p>
<p>**The Symbola Aureae Mensae** (Symbols of the Golden Table, 1617) by Michael Maier is an alchemical work presenting the wisdom of twelve ancient philosophers and alchemists through emblematic images and discourses. The text imagines a gathering of twelve sages—including Hermes Trismegistus, Maria the Jewess, Democritus, Morienus, Avicenna, and others—seated at a golden table, each contributing their wisdom about the Philosopher's Stone. Each sage is represented by an emblematic image and a discourse that presents their teachings on alchemical theory and practice. The work combines historical or legendary biography with alchemical philosophy, creating a genealogy of alchemical wisdom that traces the art from ancient Egypt through the Islamic world to medieval and Renaissance Europe.</p>
<p>Maier's *Symbola* presents each sage's contribution through an emblem that symbolizes their particular insight or discovery: Hermes with the Emerald Tablet, Maria with her apparatus for distillation, Geber with his systematic theory, and so on. The accompanying discourses discuss the sage's life, their contributions to alchemy, and their teachings about the Stone. Maier emphasizes the unity of alchemical wisdom across time and cultures, arguing that the same truth has been expressed in different forms by different masters. The work presents alchemy as an ancient tradition with a continuous lineage of authoritative teachers, each building on the wisdom of their predecessors.</p>
<p>The *Symbola Aureae Mensae* reflects Maier's broader project of defending and promoting alchemy through learned humanist scholarship. His works demonstrate extensive knowledge of classical and alchemical literature, and they present alchemy as a respectable philosophical and natural philosophical pursuit. The *Symbola* influenced later conceptions of alchemical history and the genealogy of alchemical knowledge. Modern scholarship has examined Maier's works as examples of early modern alchemical humanism and as sources for understanding how alchemists constructed their own history and tradition. The *Symbola Aureae Mensae* thus represents the creation of an alchemical canon of authoritative figures, a golden chain of wisdom-bearers who transmitted the secret of the Stone across the centuries.</p>
