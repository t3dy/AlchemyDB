Exaltation</p>
<p>**Exaltation** is the operation of raising a substance to its highest degree of purity and power through repeated operations. In alchemical practice, exaltation involved subjecting materials to multiple cycles of purification—repeated distillations, sublimations, or other operations—until they reached their most refined and potent state. The term was borrowed from astrology, where a planet in its exaltation is in its position of greatest power. In alchemy, exaltation represented the perfection of matter through repeated refinement, the elevation of substances to their highest possible state.</p>
<p>Exaltation could be achieved through various methods depending on the substance: repeated distillation of spirits to produce highly concentrated alcohol (aqua vitae exalted), repeated sublimation of mercury or sulfur to produce the most purified forms, or repeated operations on the philosophical matter to increase its power. Each cycle of exaltation was believed to remove more impurities and to concentrate the essential virtues. The exalted substance would be more pure, more powerful, and more effective than the crude material. Some texts describe specific numbers of exaltations required (seven, nine, or twelve), while others describe continuing until the substance reached its maximum purity.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, exaltation represented the elevation of matter to its highest state, the perfection of substance through repeated purification, and the manifestation of the full potential inherent in matter. The operation embodied the principle that matter contains within itself the potential for perfection, and that this potential is realized through repeated operations that remove impurities and concentrate virtues. Exaltation was associated with upward movement, with ascent toward perfection, and with the theme of realizing potential through persistent effort. The exalted substance represented matter in its most perfect state, having achieved the fullness of its nature. Exaltation thus represents both the practical operation of repeated purification to achieve maximum purity and power, and the symbolic operation of elevating matter to its highest possible perfection.</p>
