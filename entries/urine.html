Urine</p>
<p>**Urine** (Lat. *urina*) was used in alchemy, medicine, dyeing, and various chemical operations for its content of salts, urea, and other organic compounds. In alchemical practice, urine served as a source of sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride, produced by distilling urine or collecting it from soot), as a solvent for certain substances, and as a component in putrefaction processes. The *Liber de septuaginta* and other Arabic alchemical texts describe using urine in the preparation of various substances, while medieval Latin texts mention it in recipes for sal ammoniac and in operations involving organic materials. Aged or putrefied urine (which becomes alkaline as urea breaks down into ammonia) was particularly valued for its ability to dissolve certain substances and to facilitate chemical reactions.</p>
<p>In dyeing and textile processing, urine was used as a source of ammonia for mordanting (fixing dyes to fibers) and for cleaning and degreasing wool. The collection of urine for industrial purposes was a significant economic activity in medieval and early modern cities. In medicine, urine was used both diagnostically (uroscopy, the examination of urine color, clarity, and odor, was a major diagnostic technique) and therapeutically (in certain folk remedies and alchemical medicines). Some alchemical texts describe elaborate distillations of urine aimed at extracting its "essential salt" or "spirit," believed to contain vital or generative powers.</p>
<p>Modern chemistry recognizes urine as primarily composed of water, urea, and various salts (particularly sodium chloride and potassium salts), along with trace amounts of many other compounds. The breakdown of urea by bacterial action produces ammonia, explaining the alkaline properties of aged urine and its usefulness in dyeing and cleaning. The historical use of urine in alchemy and industry reflects practical knowledge of its chemical properties, even if the theoretical understanding was limited. The substance's role in alchemy also carried symbolic significance: as a product of the body's internal "digestion" and purification processes, urine was sometimes seen as analogous to the alchemical work of separating pure from impure, and its transformation through putrefaction exemplified the principle that corruption precedes regeneration.</p>
