Fixation</p>
<p>**Fixation** is the operation of making volatile substances non-volatile, transforming the fleeting into the permanent, the spiritual into the corporeal. In alchemical practice, fixation was used to stabilize mercury (making it non-volatile), to fix spirits and oils into solid form, and to complete the transformation of the philosophical matter from the volatile, unstable state to the fixed, permanent state. Fixation was often paired with volatilization in alchemical schemes: volatilization made the fixed volatile, while fixation made the volatile fixed. The ultimate goal was to fix the volatile spirit in such a way that it retained its spiritual power while gaining permanence.</p>
<p>Fixation could be achieved through various methods: combining volatile substances with fixing agents (such as fixing mercury with sulfur to produce cinnabar), heating volatile substances with fixed substances until they no longer volatilized, or subjecting volatile materials to repeated operations until they became fixed. The test of successful fixation was that the substance would no longer vaporize when heated: fixed mercury would not sublime, fixed spirits would not evaporate. Alchemists sought particularly to fix mercury, transforming it from its volatile, liquid state into a fixed, solid form that retained mercury's essential properties while gaining permanence. The fixation of mercury was often understood as a key step toward preparing the Philosopher's Stone.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, fixation represented the embodiment of spirit, the incarnation of the volatile in permanent form, and the completion of the work. The volatile spirit, having been separated, purified, and exalted, was finally fixed into permanent matter. This represented the union of spirit and body, the marriage of heaven and earth, the descent of the divine into material form. Fixation was associated with the element of earth, with downward movement, with solidification and permanence. The operation represented the principle that spiritual perfection must be embodied in material form to be complete, that the volatile must be fixed to be useful. Fixation thus represents both the practical operation of stabilizing volatile substances and the symbolic operation of embodying spirit in permanent, perfected matter.</p>
