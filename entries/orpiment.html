Orpiment</p>
<p>**Orpiment** (arsenic trisulfide, As₂S₃; Lat. *auripigmentum*, "gold pigment") is a bright yellow mineral that played a significant role in alchemy, dyeing, and painting. Its golden-yellow color led to its Latin name and to speculation about its relationship to gold: some alchemists believed that orpiment contained a "seed" of gold or that it could be transmuted into gold through proper treatment. In medieval alchemical theory, orpiment was classified as one of the "spirits" (along with mercury, sulfur, and sal ammoniac)—substances that volatilize completely when heated, leaving no residue. This volatility, combined with its color and its sulfurous nature, made it important in various alchemical operations.</p>
<p>Orpiment was used extensively as a yellow pigment in manuscript illumination and painting, despite its toxicity. It was also employed in depilatory preparations, in the dyeing of leather and textiles, and in various alchemical experiments. The *Mappae Clavicula* and other medieval technical texts describe methods for purifying orpiment, for combining it with other substances, and for using it in attempts to color or transmute metals. Some recipes describe "whitening" orpiment (perhaps by converting it to arsenic trioxide) or combining it with mercury and sulfur in complex operations aimed at producing the Philosopher's Stone.</p>
<p>The close chemical relationship between orpiment and realgar (arsenic disulfide, As₂S₂), another important alchemical substance, was recognized by medieval practitioners, who observed that realgar could be converted to orpiment through heating and that both could be sublimed to produce white arsenic (arsenic trioxide, As₂O₃). Modern chemistry understands these transformations as oxidation and reduction reactions involving arsenic and sulfur. The toxicity of orpiment and other arsenic compounds—causing skin lesions, organ damage, and death—was recognized but not fully understood in the pre-modern period. Nevertheless, the substance's golden color, its volatility, and its chemical reactivity made it important in alchemical practice and theory, representing the sulfurous principle in mineral form and embodying the hope that base, yellow substances might be perfected into true gold.</p>
