Pelican</p>
<p>**The pelican** is a specialized distillation vessel designed for continuous circulation of liquids, named after the pelican bird that was believed to feed its young with blood from its own breast. The apparatus consists of a body with two or more arms or tubes that curve back into the vessel, allowing distilled vapors to condense and return to the body for repeated distillation. This circulatory process, called cohobation or circulation, was believed to purify and exalt substances, concentrating their virtues through repeated cycles of vaporization and condensation. The pelican became an important symbol in alchemical literature, representing both the apparatus itself and the principle of self-nourishing transformation.</p>
<p>The pelican was used for operations requiring prolonged gentle heating and circulation, particularly in the preparation of quintessences, tinctures, and the philosophical mercury. Alchemists believed that repeated circulation in the pelican would gradually purify and spiritualize the matter, removing gross elements and concentrating subtle virtues. Texts describe circulating materials for weeks or months, with the number of circulations sometimes specified (seven, twelve, or forty circulations were common). The pelican's self-contained nature made it suitable for operations where the volatile spirit needed to be retained and repeatedly worked upon the fixed body.</p>
<p>The pelican's symbolic significance extended beyond its practical function. The image of the pelican feeding its young with its own blood became a Christian symbol of sacrifice and redemption, and alchemists appropriated this imagery to describe the alchemical work. The pelican vessel represented the principle of self-transformation through internal circulation, the idea that perfection comes through repeated working of spirit upon body within a sealed container. Alchemical emblems frequently depict the pelican, both as the bird and as the vessel, emphasizing themes of sacrifice, nourishment, and cyclical transformation. The pelican thus represents both a practical apparatus for circulatory distillation and a rich symbol of alchemical philosophy.</p>
