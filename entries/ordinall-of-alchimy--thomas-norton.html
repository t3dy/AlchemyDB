Ordinall of Alchimy (Thomas Norton)</p>
<p>**The Ordinall of Alchimy** is a Middle English alchemical poem composed by Thomas Norton of Bristol around 1477. Written in rhyming couplets, the *Ordinall* presents a comprehensive account of alchemical theory and practice, including descriptions of apparatus, materials, and operations, as well as moral and spiritual advice for the aspiring alchemist. Norton claims to have been taught alchemy by a master and to have witnessed successful transmutation. The *Ordinall* is notable for its relatively clear presentation of alchemical processes (by the standards of alchemical literature) and for its emphasis on the moral and spiritual qualifications necessary for alchemical success.</p>
<p>The *Ordinall* is structured in seven chapters, covering the theoretical foundations of alchemy, the nature of the Philosopher's Stone, the materials and apparatus required, the operations of the work, and the moral requirements for the alchemist. Norton emphasizes that alchemy requires not only technical knowledge but also moral virtue, divine grace, and proper instruction from a master. He warns against the many false alchemists and fraudulent practices that give the art a bad reputation. The poem provides detailed descriptions of alchemical operations, including the preparation of the philosophical mercury, the conjunction of principles, and the stages of the work marked by color changes. Norton also discusses the practical challenges of alchemical work, including the expense, the difficulty of obtaining proper materials, and the need for patience and perseverance.</p>
<p>The *Ordinall*'s significance lies in its status as one of the most important English alchemical texts and in its relatively accessible presentation of alchemical knowledge. The work was widely read in manuscript and was later printed in Elias Ashmole's *Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum* (1652), ensuring its continued influence. Norton's emphasis on the moral and spiritual dimensions of alchemy reflects the broader alchemical tradition's concern with the character and worthiness of the practitioner. The *Ordinall* represents the English alchemical tradition and demonstrates the adaptation of alchemical knowledge to vernacular languages and local contexts. The work's combination of practical instruction, theoretical explanation, and moral guidance exemplifies the multifaceted nature of alchemical literature.</p>
