Digestion</p>
<p>**Digestion** is the operation of subjecting materials to prolonged gentle heat to extract their virtues, promote transformation, or mature the philosophical matter. The term was borrowed from the physiological process of digestion, where food is broken down and its nourishment extracted through the body's gentle heat. In alchemical practice, digestion involved sealing materials in a vessel and maintaining them at gentle, constant heat (often in a bain-marie or athanor) for extended periods—days, weeks, or months. The operation was believed to extract essences, to promote the gradual transformation of matter, and to mature the Stone.</p>
<p>Digestion was used for various purposes: extracting medicinal virtues from plants or minerals, preparing tinctures and quintessences, maturing the philosophical matter during the Great Work, and promoting the gradual transformation of substances. The operation required careful temperature control: the heat had to be gentle and constant, comparable to the warmth of the sun, the heat of a hen incubating eggs, or the warmth of the human body. Too much heat would cause distillation or decomposition, while too little heat would prevent the desired transformation. The vessel had to be properly sealed to prevent evaporation while allowing the internal circulation of vapors. Digestion was often combined with circulation, where vapors would rise, condense, and return to the matter, repeatedly working upon it.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, digestion represented the slow, natural maturation of matter, the gentle cooking that brings substances to perfection. The operation was compared to the ripening of fruit, the gestation of a child in the womb, or the incubation of an egg. Digestion represented the principle that transformation requires time and patience, that perfection cannot be rushed but must develop gradually through sustained gentle heat. The operation was associated with the element of water (gentle, nurturing), with the womb, and with themes of gestation, maturation, and natural growth. Digestion thus represents both the practical operation of extracting and transforming through gentle heat and the symbolic operation of natural, patient maturation toward perfection.</p>
