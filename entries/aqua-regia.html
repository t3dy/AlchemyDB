Aqua Regia</p>
<p>**Aqua regia** (Lat. "royal water") is a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids capable of dissolving gold, the "king of metals"—hence its name. The discovery of aqua regia in the medieval period represented a major breakthrough in alchemy, demonstrating that even the most noble and incorruptible metal could be dissolved and manipulated. The *Summa Perfectionis* and other thirteenth-century Latin texts describe the preparation of aqua regia by combining "aqua fortis" (nitric acid, distilled from saltpeter and vitriol) with sal ammoniac or common salt, producing a powerfully corrosive liquid that could dissolve gold and platinum (metals resistant to either acid alone).</p>
<p>The ability to dissolve gold was theoretically significant for alchemy: if gold could be reduced to a liquid state, separated from its impurities, and then reconstituted, this seemed to open the possibility of perfecting imperfect gold or even of transmuting other metals into gold by impregnating them with gold's essence. Alchemists developed elaborate procedures for dissolving gold in aqua regia, evaporating the solution to dryness, and recovering the gold through various means—sometimes claiming that the recovered gold was purer or more potent than the original. The "aurum potabile" (potable gold) prepared by some Paracelsian physicians involved dissolving gold in aqua regia and then attempting to render the solution safe for internal consumption, believing that gold's incorruptibility could be transferred to the human body.</p>
<p>The preparation and use of aqua regia required sophisticated understanding of acids and their properties. The mixture's ability to dissolve gold results from the combination of nitric acid (which oxidizes the gold) and hydrochloric acid (which provides chloride ions to form soluble gold chloride complexes)—a synergistic effect that neither acid achieves alone. Modern chemistry recognizes this as a classic example of chemical cooperation. Lawrence Principe's research has shown how the development of mineral acids, including aqua regia, represented one of alchemy's most important contributions to chemistry, enabling new analytical techniques and synthetic procedures. The symbolic dimension of aqua regia—a water that could "kill" the immortal king, dissolve the incorruptible, and reduce the most perfect metal to liquid form—made it central to alchemical allegory, representing the power of the art to overcome nature's most stubborn resistances and to manipulate even the most exalted substances.</p>
