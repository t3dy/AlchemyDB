Sublimation</p>
<p>**Sublimation** is the operation of transforming a solid directly into vapor by heating, then condensing the vapor back to solid form, without passing through the liquid state. In alchemical practice, sublimation was used to purify substances (particularly mercury, sulfur, arsenic compounds, and sal ammoniac), to separate volatile from non-volatile components, and to prepare refined materials for further operations. The operation required specialized apparatus (aludels stacked to form a sublimation tower, or closed vessels where sublimed material would condense on the upper surfaces) and careful heat control.</p>
<p>Sublimation was particularly important for working with mercury and sulfur, the two principles of metals. Mercury could be sublimed repeatedly to purify it, removing earthy and metallic impurities. Sulfur could be sublimed to produce flowers of sulfur, a fine, pure form. Sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) sublimed readily and was used both as a substance in its own right and as a flux to aid in subliming other materials. The sublimation operation involved heating the material in the lower vessel, allowing the vapors to rise and condense on the cooler upper surfaces or in the upper vessels of the aludel tower, then collecting the sublimed material. Repeated sublimation (subliming the same material multiple times) produced increasingly pure products.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, sublimation represented the elevation and purification of matter, the transformation of the gross into the subtle. The operation was seen as a form of distillation but more powerful, as the material was transformed directly from solid to vapor without becoming liquid. Sublimation represented the ascent of the spirit, the purification through fire and air, the separation of the pure from the impure. The sublimed material, condensing in the upper part of the apparatus, was the purified essence, while the non-volatile residue remaining below was the dross. Sublimation was associated with upward movement, with the element of air, and with spiritual elevation. The operation represented the alchemical principle that matter could be purified and exalted through repeated operations, each cycle removing more impurities and concentrating the essential virtues. Sublimation thus represents both the practical operation of purifying through vapor-phase transformation and the symbolic operation of elevating and spiritualizing matter.</p>
