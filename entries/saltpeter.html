Saltpeter</p>
<p>**Saltpeter** (potassium nitrate, KNO₃; Lat. *sal petrae*, "salt of stone") is a white crystalline salt that became crucial to both alchemy and military technology as the essential ingredient in gunpowder. Naturally occurring as efflorescence on cave walls, stable walls, and in certain soils (particularly those enriched with animal waste), saltpeter was recognized by medieval alchemists for its remarkable properties: it enhanced combustion dramatically, it could be used to produce powerful acids, and it seemed to contain a "nitrous spirit" or aerial principle that supported fire and life. The *Liber Ignium* (Book of Fires) attributed to Marcus Graecus (c. 13th century) describes various incendiary compositions using saltpeter, while the *Summa Perfectionis* and other alchemical texts discuss its use in preparing aqua fortis (nitric acid) through distillation with vitriol.</p>
<p>The preparation of saltpeter through the systematic cultivation of "nitre beds"—heaps of organic waste, earth, and lime that were periodically watered and turned to promote the formation of nitrates—became an important chemical industry in early modern Europe. Treatises on saltpeter production, such as those by Vannoccio Biringuccio (*Pirotechnia*, 1540) and Lazarus Ercker, describe the extraction and purification processes in detail. In alchemy, saltpeter was essential for producing nitric acid (aqua fortis), which in turn was used to prepare aqua regia, to separate gold from silver, and to dissolve various metals. The "spirit of nitre" (nitric acid) was regarded as one of the most powerful alchemical solvents, capable of transforming metals and revealing their hidden natures.</p>
<p>The explosive properties of saltpeter-based gunpowder revolutionized warfare, but alchemists were more interested in its chemical properties and its theoretical significance. Some alchemists, including Sendivogius and later Robert Boyle, speculated that saltpeter contained a "nitro-aerial spirit" or "universal spirit" that was the active principle in combustion, respiration, and perhaps even transmutation. Modern chemistry recognizes saltpeter as potassium nitrate, a powerful oxidizing agent that releases oxygen when heated, explaining its role in enhancing combustion and in gunpowder. The substance's dual significance—as both a military explosive and an alchemical reagent—reflects the complex relationship between practical chemistry, natural philosophy, and technological innovation in the early modern period. Saltpeter thus represents how a single substance could transform both the art of war and the art of alchemy, embodying the power of chemical knowledge to reshape the material world.</p>
