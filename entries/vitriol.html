Vitriol</p>
<p>**Vitriol** (from Latin *vitreolus*, "glassy"; also *vitriolum*) is the collective name for a family of crystalline sulfate salts that played a central role in medieval and early modern alchemy, chemistry, and medicine. The most important varieties were green vitriol (ferrous sulfate, *vitriolum viride*), blue vitriol (copper sulfate, *vitriolum caeruleum*), and white vitriol (zinc sulfate, *vitriolum album*), each distinguished by color and source mineral. Medieval alchemists prized vitriol for its powerful corrosive properties and its role in producing "oil of vitriol" (sulfuric acid), one of the most important mineral acids in the alchemical laboratory. The *Summa Perfectionis* and other Geberian texts describe the distillation of vitriol to produce a "sharp water" capable of dissolving metals, separating gold from silver, and serving as a solvent in numerous transmutational processes.</p>
<p>The preparation of oil of vitriol became increasingly sophisticated in the early modern period, with practitioners like Basil Valentine (in the *Triumphal Chariot of Antimony*) and Andreas Libavius (in the *Alchemia*, 1597) providing detailed procedures for its distillation and concentration. The acid's remarkable properties—its ability to char organic materials, dissolve metals, and generate intense heat when mixed with water—made it seem like a manifestation of elemental fire in liquid form. Paracelsian iatrochemists used vitriol and its derivatives extensively in medicine, preparing "elixir of vitriol" (diluted sulfuric acid) as a tonic and using vitriol salts as astringents and antiseptics. The substance's dual nature as both destructive solvent and healing medicine exemplified the alchemical principle that the same agent could kill or cure depending on its preparation and dosage.</p>
<p>The symbolic significance of vitriol was crystallized in the famous Rosicrucian acronym **V.I.T.R.I.O.L.**, standing for "*Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem*" ("Visit the interior of the earth, and by rectifying you will find the hidden stone"). This motto, which appeared in alchemical texts from the seventeenth century onward, transformed vitriol from a mere chemical substance into an emblem of the alchemical quest itself: the descent into the depths of matter (and the self), the process of purification and rectification, and the discovery of the Philosopher's Stone hidden within the most common materials. Modern chemistry recognizes vitriol salts as important industrial chemicals and understands sulfuric acid as one of the fundamental reagents in chemical synthesis. William Newman's research has shown how medieval and early modern work with vitriol contributed to the development of mineral acid chemistry, analytical techniques, and the understanding of chemical reactions. The substance thus bridges practical chemistry, symbolic alchemy, and spiritual allegory, embodying the alchemical conviction that the secrets of transformation lie hidden in the earth, waiting to be discovered by those who know how to look.</p>
