Projection</p>
<p>**Projection** is the final operation of the alchemical work, where the perfected Philosopher's Stone is cast upon molten base metal to transmute it into gold or silver. The term "projection" refers to throwing or casting the Stone (often wrapped in wax or paper to protect it from the heat) onto the surface of the molten metal. The Stone would penetrate the metal, transforming it throughout into the noble metal. Projection represented the culmination of the alchemical work, the demonstration of the Stone's power, and the practical application of the art to produce gold or silver.</p>
<p>The projection operation was described in various ways in alchemical texts. The Stone, having been perfected through the long series of operations, was prepared for projection by grinding it to powder (if solid) or diluting it (if liquid). A small quantity of the Stone—sometimes described as a grain, sometimes as a larger amount—was wrapped in wax or paper and cast upon molten lead, tin, copper, or other base metal. The Stone would penetrate the metal, transmuting it into gold (if using the red Stone) or silver (if using the white Stone). The transmuted metal could then be tested by standard assaying methods to verify its purity. Some texts describe the Stone as having the power of multiplication: one part of Stone could transmute many parts of base metal (ratios of 1:100, 1:1000, or even higher were claimed).</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, projection represented the final proof of success, the manifestation of the Stone's power, and the completion of the Great Work. The operation demonstrated that the alchemist had truly achieved the Stone and that the art of transmutation was real. Projection was associated with the color red (for the red Stone and gold) or white (for the white Stone and silver), with the completion and perfection of the work, and with the theme of manifestation and demonstration. The successful projection proved that the alchemist had mastered the art, had understood nature's secrets, and had achieved the goal of perfecting matter. Projection thus represents both the practical operation of transmuting base metals and the symbolic operation of manifesting perfection and demonstrating the power of the completed work.</p>
