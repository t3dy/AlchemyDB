Circulation</p>
<p>**Circulation** is the operation of repeatedly distilling and condensing a liquid within a sealed vessel, allowing the vapors to rise and condense, then return to the body for repeated cycles. In alchemical practice, circulation was performed in specialized vessels (the pelican, or sealed vessels with arms that returned condensed vapors to the body) and was believed to purify and exalt substances through repeated cycles of vaporization and condensation. The operation was used to prepare quintessences, to purify spirits, and to perfect the philosophical matter through repeated working of the volatile upon the fixed.</p>
<p>Circulation involved sealing the material in a vessel designed for circulatory distillation, then heating it gently. The volatile components would vaporize, rise into the arms or upper part of the vessel, condense, and flow back down into the body. This cycle would repeat continuously as long as heat was maintained. The repeated circulation was believed to gradually purify the matter, to concentrate its virtues, and to promote the union of volatile and fixed principles. Texts describe circulating materials for specific numbers of cycles (seven, twelve, forty, or more) or for specific durations (days, weeks, months). Each circulation was believed to increase the purity and power of the substance.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, circulation represented the repeated interaction of spirit and body, the marriage of volatile and fixed through continuous cycles of separation and reunion. The operation embodied the principle "ascendit a terra in coelum, iterumque descendit in terram" (it ascends from earth to heaven, and again descends to earth) from the Emerald Tablet. Circulation represented the cyclical nature of transformation, the idea that perfection is achieved through repeated operations rather than a single transformation. The operation was associated with the ouroboros (the serpent eating its tail), with cyclical time, and with the theme of eternal return and continuous refinement. Circulation thus represents both the practical operation of repeated distillation and condensation, and the symbolic operation of continuous refinement through cyclical interaction of principles.</p>
