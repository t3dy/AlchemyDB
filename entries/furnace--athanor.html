Furnace (Athanor)</p>
<p>**The athanor** is a specialized furnace designed to maintain constant, even heat for extended periods, essential for alchemical operations requiring prolonged heating. The name derives from Arabic *al-tannūr* (oven), and the athanor became the characteristic furnace of alchemical laboratories. The athanor typically featured a tower-like structure with a combustion chamber at the bottom, a chamber for the vessel being heated in the middle, and a chimney at the top. The design allowed for slow, controlled combustion of fuel (usually charcoal) and even distribution of heat around the vessel.</p>
<p>The athanor's key feature was its ability to maintain heat for days, weeks, or even months with minimal attention. This was achieved through careful design: a large fuel chamber that could hold enough charcoal for extended burning, regulated air flow to control combustion rate, and thick walls to retain heat and provide insulation. Some athanors featured a "tower of fire" design where fuel was loaded from the top and burned slowly downward, providing very constant heat. The athanor was essential for operations like digestion, circulation, and the preparation of the Philosopher's Stone, which texts describe as requiring months of constant gentle heat.</p>
<p>The athanor appears constantly in alchemical literature and illustrations, often depicted as a tower-like structure with a vessel inside. The furnace became a symbol of the alchemical work itself: the constant fire represented the philosophical fire, the heat of transformation that must be maintained steadily throughout the work. Texts emphasize the importance of regulating the fire, comparing it to the heat of the sun, the warmth of a hen incubating eggs, or the heat of the human body. The athanor thus represents both the practical furnace for maintaining constant heat and the symbolic fire of alchemical transformation.</p>
