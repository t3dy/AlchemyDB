Zosimos of Panopolis</p>
<p>**Zosimos of Panopolis** (fl. c. 300 CE) is the earliest alchemical author whose works survive in significant quantity, and his writings represent a crucial link between the practical metallurgical traditions of Hellenistic Egypt and the mystical, allegorical alchemy that would flourish in later centuries. Writing in Greek during the late Roman period, Zosimos composed an encyclopedic work titled *Cheirokmeta* (Things Made by Hand), of which substantial fragments survive in Byzantine manuscripts. His texts combine practical laboratory procedures—descriptions of apparatus, recipes for alloys and tinctures, instructions for working with metals and minerals—with elaborate allegorical visions, Gnostic theology, and philosophical speculation about the nature of matter and transformation. This dual character, simultaneously technical and mystical, would become characteristic of the alchemical tradition as a whole.</p>
<p>Zosimos's most famous writings are his visionary accounts, particularly the "Visions of Zosimos," in which he describes dreams of priests being tortured, dismembered, and boiled in cauldrons, only to be reconstituted and transformed. These violent images have been interpreted as allegories of chemical processes—the dissolution, putrefaction, and reconstitution of metals—but they also carry profound religious and psychological significance, drawing on Gnostic ideas about the imprisonment of spirit in matter and the violent transformations necessary for liberation. Zosimos explicitly connects his alchemical work to the "sacred art" (*hiera techne*) of the ancient Egyptians, claiming to transmit secret knowledge passed down from the legendary Hermes Trismegistus and the biblical Enoch. He polemicizes against mere "dyers" and "goldsmiths" who work with superficial appearances, insisting that true alchemy requires understanding the inner natures of substances and the spiritual dimensions of transformation.</p>
<p>Modern scholarship has revealed the complexity of Zosimos's sources and influence. His work draws on Egyptian metallurgical practices, Greek natural philosophy (particularly Stoic and Aristotelian theories of matter), and Gnostic religious speculation, synthesizing these diverse traditions into a distinctive alchemical worldview. Michèle Mertens's critical edition of Zosimos's texts has clarified the manuscript tradition and revealed the sophistication of his chemical knowledge, including his descriptions of distillation apparatus, his understanding of alloys and amalgams, and his theories about the transformation of metals. Zosimos's influence on later alchemy was profound: Byzantine alchemists cited him as the supreme authority, Arabic alchemists translated and commented on his works, and Latin medieval alchemists knew him (often inaccurately) through translations and paraphrases. His vision of alchemy as simultaneously a material craft and a spiritual discipline, a practical art and a path to gnosis, established a paradigm that would shape alchemical thought for over a millennium, making him not merely the first alchemical author we can name but one of the most influential.</p>
