Johann Rudolf Glauber</p>
<p>**Johann Rudolf Glauber** (1604–1670) was a German-Dutch alchemist and chemical manufacturer whose practical chemical work and entrepreneurial activities helped transform alchemy into industrial chemistry. Glauber discovered numerous chemical substances and processes, including sodium sulfate (Glauber's salt), hydrochloric acid production, and improved methods for producing nitric acid and sulfuric acid. His numerous works combined practical chemical recipes with alchemical theory and utopian visions of chemical prosperity. Glauber represents the commercialization and industrialization of alchemical knowledge in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Glauber established chemical workshops in Amsterdam and other cities, producing and selling chemical products including medicines, dyes, and industrial chemicals. He published extensively on practical chemistry, providing detailed descriptions of chemical processes and apparatus. His works, including *Furni Novi Philosophici* (1646–1649) and *Prosperitatis Germaniae* (1656–1661), combined practical instructions with broader visions of how chemistry could contribute to economic prosperity and social welfare. Glauber believed that chemistry could transform society by providing new medicines, improving agriculture, and creating new industries.</p>
<p>Glauber's significance lies in his demonstration that chemical knowledge could be commercially profitable and socially beneficial. His chemical manufacturing activities helped establish chemistry as an industrial enterprise rather than merely a scholarly pursuit or artisanal craft. Glauber's detailed publications made chemical knowledge more widely accessible and contributed to the spread of practical chemical expertise. His work on acids, salts, and chemical processes advanced practical chemistry and influenced later chemical industry. Glauber represents the transformation of alchemy from a quest for transmutation into a practical chemical enterprise focused on useful products and processes.</p>
