# Report: Textual Summaries & Critical Apparatus

**Phase:** 13
**Status:** Strategy Drafted
**Focus:** Elevating the archive from a "List of Files" to a "Symphony of Manuscripts."

## The "Textual Summary" Objective
While the **Discovery Dashboard** provides a bird's-eye view of your 205 PDFs, and the **Lexicon** tracks specific entities, the **Textual Summary** layer provides the narrative glue. 

We are moving into a phase where we analyze the *structure* and *thematic core* of your most significant alchemical texts.

## The Strategy: Deep Semantic Harvesting
1. **Thematic Detection**: Identifying the primary goal of a text (e.g., *Is this about metallurgical transmutations or spiritual ascent?*).
2. **Structural Breakdown**: Summarizing the "Argument" of the text. For example, in Kahn's work, we will highlight the interplay between Paracelsianism and early modern science.
3. **Critical Apparatus**: Associating each text with its **Citations** and **Historical Context**.

## Top 5 Manuscripts for Initial Analysis
Based on our current database weights, we will prioritize:
1. **Paracelsus's Medical Corpus**: Analyzing the revolutionary "chemical medicine" shift.
2. **Splendor Solis**: Summarizing the allegorical visual-textual interplay.
3. **Monas Hieroglyphica (John Dee)**: A summary of the dense symbolic geometry.
4. **Michael Maier's Emblem Books**: Analysis of the musical and mythological synthesis.
5. **The works of Didier Kahn**: Summarizing the modern historiographical lens through which much of this library is viewed.

## Integration
These summaries will live in a new **TEXTS** section of the dashboard, allowing you to click a book in your library and see a rich, scholarly abstract before diving into the individual mentions.
