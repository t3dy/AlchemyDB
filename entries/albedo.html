Albedo</p>
<p>**Albedo** (Lat. "whitening"; also *leucosis* or the "white phase") is the second major stage in the alchemical *magnum opus*, following the blackening of nigredo and representing purification, illumination, and the emergence of the "white stone" or "white elixir." In laboratory practice, albedo manifested as the appearance of white precipitates, crystals, or sublimated materials during distillation, sublimation, or the washing of calcined substances. Medieval texts describe this phase as the washing away of impurities, the separation of the pure from the impure, and the first glimpse of success after the trials of putrefaction. The *Rosarium Philosophorum* depicts the whitening as the reunion of the king and queen in a purified state, while emblem books show white doves, swans, or the moon—symbols of purity, peace, and the feminine principle.</p>
<p>The technical procedures associated with albedo varied across different alchemical traditions. In the medieval Geberian tradition, whitening was achieved through repeated sublimations and distillations, often involving mercury and arsenic compounds that produced white crystalline substances. The *Summa Perfectionis* describes the "whitening of the body" as the removal of the "combustible sulphur" that darkened metals, leaving behind a purified metallic essence. Paracelsian iatrochemists interpreted albedo more broadly as the extraction of the "essential salt" or "quintessence" from substances—the white crystalline residues left after distillation or the white oils obtained from certain plants. George Ripley's *Twelve Gates* (1471) devotes an entire gate to "Albification," describing it as the crucial transition from the work in black to the work in white, from death to resurrection.</p>
<p>Symbolically, albedo represented spiritual purification and the attainment of a preliminary perfection. While not the final goal (which required the reddening of rubedo), the white stone was considered a significant achievement, capable of transmuting base metals into silver and conferring certain medicinal virtues. In Jungian interpretation, albedo corresponds to the emergence of consciousness from the unconscious, the dawning of insight after the dark night of nigredo, and the beginning of psychological integration. Modern chemical analysis has shown that many historical "whitening" processes involved the formation of white metal oxides, chlorides, or sulfates—genuine chemical transformations that alchemists interpreted through their theoretical framework of purification and perfection. Lawrence Principe's laboratory replications demonstrate that procedures described in texts like the *Atalanta Fugiens* could indeed produce striking white substances, lending empirical support to the alchemists' conviction that they were witnessing the progressive purification of matter. The white phase thus represents both a chemical milestone and a symbolic threshold, the moment when the work transitions from destruction to reconstruction, from chaos to order, from darkness to light.</p>
