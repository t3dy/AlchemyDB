Pyrite</p>
<p>**Pyrite** (iron disulfide, FeS₂; also called *fool's gold* or *iron pyrites*) is a brassy-yellow mineral with a metallic luster that was sometimes mistaken for gold, hence its nickname. Known since antiquity, pyrite was recognized as a source of sulfur and iron, and it played a role in the production of sulfuric acid and in various metallurgical processes. When struck with steel, pyrite produces sparks, making it useful for fire-starting before the invention of matches. In alchemical and mineralogical texts, pyrite was often grouped with marcasites as an immature or imperfect metallic substance, a "half-metal" that contained metallic principles but had not achieved full metallic perfection.</p>
<p>The roasting of pyrite to produce sulfuric acid (oil of vitriol) was an important chemical industry in the early modern period. When heated in air, pyrite oxidizes to produce iron oxide and sulfur dioxide, which can be further oxidized and dissolved in water to produce sulfuric acid. This process, described in texts like Agricola's *De Re Metallica* (1556) and Libavius's *Alchemia* (1597), provided one of the main sources of this crucial acid. Pyrite was also used in attempts to extract gold or silver, based on the belief that its golden color indicated the presence of noble metals. Some alchemists experimented with pyrite in transmutational operations, attempting to "perfect" its metallic content or to use it as a source of philosophical sulfur.</p>
<p>Modern chemistry recognizes pyrite as iron disulfide, a common and widespread mineral that is indeed a source of sulfur and iron but contains no gold despite its appearance. The oxidation of pyrite in air or water produces sulfuric acid and iron oxides, a process that occurs naturally in mine tailings and can cause environmental problems (acid mine drainage). The historical use of pyrite in acid production represents genuine chemical knowledge, even if the theoretical understanding was limited. The mineral's deceptive appearance—golden but not gold—made it a fitting symbol for alchemical themes of appearance versus reality, the need to look beyond surface properties to understand true natures, and the distinction between mere imitation and genuine transformation.</p>
