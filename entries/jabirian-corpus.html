Jabirian Corpus</p>
<p>**The Jabirian Corpus** is a vast collection of Arabic alchemical and scientific texts attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan (Latinized as Geber), though modern scholarship suggests these works were composed by multiple authors over several centuries, probably between the ninth and eleventh centuries. The corpus includes hundreds of treatises on alchemy, cosmology, medicine, and natural philosophy, presenting a comprehensive alchemical system based on the theory of balance and the manipulation of qualities. The Jabirian texts were enormously influential in both the Islamic world and medieval Latin Europe, where they were translated and became foundational texts of Western alchemy.</p>
<p>The Jabirian corpus presents alchemy as a systematic science based on the Aristotelian theory of matter and qualities. The texts develop a theory of metallic generation based on the combination of mercury and sulfur in different proportions and degrees of purity, with the various metals resulting from different balances of hot, cold, dry, and moist qualities. The corpus introduces the concept of the "elixir" (al-iksir), the substance capable of transmuting base metals to gold by perfecting their balance of qualities. The texts also present elaborate numerical and cosmological theories, connecting alchemy to astrology, medicine, and broader natural philosophy. The Jabirian works emphasize the importance of experimental investigation and provide detailed descriptions of chemical apparatus and procedures.</p>
<p>The Jabirian corpus's significance lies in its foundational role in both Islamic and Western alchemy. The texts established many of the theoretical principles that would dominate alchemical thought for centuries, including the mercury-sulfur theory of metallic generation and the concept of transmutation through the perfection of qualities. The Latin translations of Jabirian texts (attributed to "Geber") were among the most widely read alchemical works in medieval and Renaissance Europe. Modern scholarship on the Jabirian corpus has revealed the sophistication of early Islamic alchemy and its contributions to the development of chemistry. The corpus represents the systematization of alchemy as a comprehensive natural philosophy grounded in Aristotelian matter theory and experimental practice.</p>
