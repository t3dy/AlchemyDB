Separation</p>
<p>**Separation** is the operation of dividing a mixture into its components, isolating pure substances from impure mixtures, or separating the subtle from the gross. In alchemical practice, separation was achieved through various methods: distillation (separating volatile from fixed), filtration (separating solid from liquid), crystallization (separating dissolved substance from solvent), and extraction (separating one component using selective solvents). Separation was fundamental to alchemical work, as the purification and isolation of principles was necessary for their subsequent recombination in perfected form.</p>
<p>The methods of separation were diverse and sophisticated. Distillation separated components based on their volatility: heating a mixture would vaporize the more volatile components, which could then be condensed and collected separately from the less volatile residues. Fractional distillation, using multiple distillations or specialized apparatus, could separate components with similar volatilities. Filtration separated solids from liquids, with different filtering media (cloth, paper, sand, charcoal) used depending on the fineness of separation required. Crystallization separated dissolved substances by allowing them to crystallize from solution, with different substances crystallizing at different temperatures or concentrations. Extraction used selective solvents to dissolve one component of a mixture while leaving others undissolved.</p>
<p>In alchemical philosophy, separation was one of the most important operations, often described as the key to the entire work. The maxim "solve et coagula" (dissolve and coagulate) emphasized the importance of separating principles before recombining them. Separation allowed the alchemist to isolate the pure from the impure, the essential from the accidental, the subtle from the gross. The operation was described in symbolic terms: separating the soul from the body, the spirit from matter, the volatile from the fixed. Alchemical emblems depict separation through images of division: the separation of heaven and earth, the separation of elements, the cutting or dismemberment of bodies. Separation was associated with the sword, with discrimination and judgment, and with the analytical aspect of the work. Separation thus represents both the practical operations of isolating components and the symbolic operation of discriminating and purifying principles.</p>
