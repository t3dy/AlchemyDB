Reverberation</p>
<p>**Reverberation** is the operation of heating a substance in a reverberatory furnace, where heat is reflected from the furnace roof onto the material, producing intense, even heating without direct contact with the fire. In alchemical practice, reverberation was used for calcination, for heating materials that required intense but controlled heat, and for operations where direct contact with fire would be harmful. The reverberatory furnace allowed for strong heating while protecting materials from ash, smoke, or direct flame. The operation was particularly used in metallurgical operations and in preparing certain alchemical materials.</p>
<p>The reverberatory furnace featured a design where the fire was in a separate chamber from the material being heated. The heat and flames would pass over the material and be reflected (reverberated) from the arched roof of the furnace, providing intense, even heating from above. This allowed for high temperatures while keeping the material separate from the fire. Reverberation was used for calcining metals and minerals, for fusing materials, for operations requiring strong, sustained heat, and for preparing materials that would be contaminated by direct contact with fire or fuel. The operation could be continued for extended periods, producing thorough calcination or transformation.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, reverberation represented the action of reflected or indirect force, the transformation through heat that comes from above rather than below. The operation was associated with the sun's heat reflected from the heavens, with divine influence acting upon matter, and with the theme of transformation through celestial or spiritual fire rather than earthly fire. Reverberation represented the principle that some transformations require indirect action, that reflected force can be as powerful as direct force. The operation was associated with the element of fire, with intense heat, and with thorough, penetrating transformation. Reverberation thus represents both the practical operation of heating by reflected heat and the symbolic operation of transformation through celestial or reflected force.</p>
