Rosarium Philosophorum</p>
<p>**The Rosarium Philosophorum** (Rosary of the Philosophers) is one of the most important and influential alchemical texts of the sixteenth century, first published in Frankfurt in 1550 as part of the anthology *De Alchimia Opuscula*. The work is particularly famous for its series of twenty woodcut illustrations depicting the chemical marriage and the stages of the alchemical work, which have become iconic images in alchemical literature. The *Rosarium* presents the alchemical process through a combination of text and images, with the illustrations showing the union of King and Queen (sun and moon, sulfur and mercury) and their transformation through death, putrefaction, and resurrection into the Philosopher's Stone.</p>
<p>The *Rosarium* is structured as a dialogue and commentary on alchemical processes, drawing on earlier alchemical authorities and presenting the work as a series of operations. The twenty woodcut illustrations form a visual narrative of the chemical marriage: the King and Queen meet, disrobe, enter the bath together, unite in sexual conjunction, die and putrefy in the tomb, and are eventually resurrected as the hermaphroditic rebis and finally as the crowned philosophical child. Each image is accompanied by explanatory text describing the alchemical significance of the depicted stage. The work emphasizes the importance of the proper conjunction of purified sulfur and mercury and the necessity of death and putrefaction before regeneration.</p>
<p>The *Rosarium*'s significance lies in its visual presentation of alchemical philosophy and its influence on later alchemical thought. The woodcut series became one of the most reproduced and influential sets of alchemical images, appearing in numerous later works and serving as a model for other alchemical emblem books. Carl Jung extensively analyzed the *Rosarium* illustrations in his psychological interpretation of alchemy, seeing them as symbolic representations of the integration of opposites in the psyche. The *Rosarium* represents the Renaissance synthesis of alchemical theory and practice, presenting the Great Work as both a chemical process and a symbolic representation of transformation and union.</p>
