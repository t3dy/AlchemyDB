Nicolas Flamel</p>
<p>**Nicolas Flamel** (c. 1330-1418) was a Parisian scribe and bookseller who became, through legend and alchemical literature, one of the most famous alchemists in history, credited with achieving the Philosopher's Stone and transmuting base metals into gold. The historical Flamel was a successful bourgeois who made charitable donations and commissioned religious artworks, but there is no contemporary evidence that he practiced alchemy. His posthumous transformation into an alchemical master began in the seventeenth century with the publication of texts attributed to him, particularly the *Livre des figures hiéroglyphiques* (Book of Hieroglyphic Figures, 1612), which claimed to explain the alchemical symbolism of sculptures Flamel had commissioned for the Cemetery of the Innocents in Paris. This text narrated how Flamel acquired a mysterious book of alchemical secrets, studied it for years, consulted with learned Jews in Spain, and finally succeeded in making the Stone with his wife Perenelle.</p>
<p>The legend of Flamel's alchemical success became enormously popular, amplified by the visual appeal of the "hieroglyphic figures" supposedly carved on the Cemetery arch (actually conventional religious imagery reinterpreted through an alchemical lens). The narrative combined appealing elements: the humble scribe who achieves the Great Work through patience and divine favor, the mysterious book that contains the secret, the journey to Spain for wisdom, and the successful transmutation witnessed by the pious couple. Later alchemical writers elaborated the legend, adding details and attributing additional texts to Flamel. His supposed wealth and charitable works were cited as evidence of his alchemical success, while his and Perenelle's tombs became objects of interest for treasure-seekers and alchemical pilgrims.</p>
<p>Modern historical research, particularly by Claude Gagnon and others, has thoroughly debunked the alchemical legend, showing that all texts attributed to Flamel are seventeenth-century or later forgeries, and that the historical Flamel's wealth can be adequately explained by his successful scribal and property businesses. Nevertheless, the legend persists in popular culture and esoteric literature, where Flamel remains the archetypal successful alchemist. The case of Nicolas Flamel exemplifies how posthumous legend-making could transform an ordinary historical figure into an alchemical hero, and how alchemical literature created its own mythology of successful practitioners to inspire and instruct later seekers. Flamel thus represents the power of alchemical narrative to create exemplary figures whose legendary achievements transcended historical reality.</p>
