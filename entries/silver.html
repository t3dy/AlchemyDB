Silver</p>
<p>**Silver** (Lat. *argentum*; alchemical symbol ☽) is the second-most perfect metal in alchemical hierarchy, associated with the moon, femininity, and the white phase (albedo) of the Great Work. In medieval matter theory, silver was understood as nearly perfect, possessing pure Mercury but slightly impure or "unripe" Sulphur—hence its white color rather than gold's yellow, and its susceptibility to tarnishing when exposed to sulfur compounds. The *Turba Philosophorum* and other early Latin texts describe silver as the "white queen" to gold's "red king," the feminine principle that must be united with the masculine in the alchemical marriage. Silver's association with the moon extended beyond mere symbolism: lunar cycles were believed to influence the generation of silver in the earth, and some alchemists timed their operations according to the moon's phases.</p>
<p>The practical importance of silver in alchemy extended beyond its symbolic role. Silver was used extensively in cupellation, the process of separating gold from silver and base metals using lead oxide, a technique that was fundamental to both metallurgy and alchemical practice. The *Probierbüchlein* (Little Testing Book, c. 1520) and other assaying manuals describe sophisticated methods for testing silver purity, separating silver from copper and lead, and recovering silver from ores. Alchemists also worked extensively with silver nitrate (lunar caustic), silver chloride (luna cornea or horn silver), and various silver amalgams. The "tree of Diana" or "arbor philosophorum"—a beautiful dendritic crystal formation produced by precipitating silver from solution—was regarded as a minor marvel, demonstrating the "vegetative" power of metals to grow and ramify like plants.</p>
<p>The white stone or white elixir, capable of transmuting base metals into silver, was considered a significant achievement in the alchemical work, though inferior to the red stone that produced gold. Some practitioners, including George Starkey, claimed to have achieved the white work while still pursuing the more perfect red. Modern chemistry recognizes silver (Ag, atomic number 47) as an element with unique properties: the highest electrical and thermal conductivity of any metal, and a pronounced tendency to form compounds with sulfur (hence its tarnishing). William Newman's research has shown how alchemical work with silver contributed to the development of analytical chemistry, particularly techniques for precipitation, crystallization, and the separation of metals. The metal's symbolic associations—with purity, reflection, the feminine, and the lunar—made it central to alchemical iconography and spiritual interpretation, where the achievement of the white stone represented a preliminary perfection, a purification of the soul that prepared the way for the final reddening and the attainment of spiritual gold.</p>
