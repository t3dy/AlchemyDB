Quicksilver</p>
<p>**Quicksilver** (common mercury, Lat. *argentum vivum* or *hydrargyrum*; alchemical symbol ☿) is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature, a property that made it central to alchemical theory and practice. Distinguished from "philosophical Mercury" (the purified or animated quicksilver sought by alchemists), common quicksilver was understood as the material embodiment of the mercurial principle—volatile, fluid, penetrating, and capable of dissolving and amalgamating with other metals. Its silvery luster, its ability to flow and divide into perfect spheres, and its capacity to "swallow" gold and silver (forming amalgams) made it seem almost alive, hence its Latin name *argentum vivum* (living silver).</p>
<p>The extraction of quicksilver from cinnabar through heating was one of the foundational operations of alchemy, demonstrating the separation of Mercury from Sulphur and providing a tangible example of how substances could be decomposed and reconstituted. Medieval and early modern alchemists developed numerous techniques for "killing" (fixing) and "reviving" (volatilizing) mercury, for purifying it through repeated distillations, and for preparing mercury compounds such as mercury sublimate (mercuric chloride, HgCl₂), calomel (mercurous chloride, Hg₂Cl₂), and various mercury oxides. The *Summa Perfectionis* and other Geberian texts describe elaborate procedures for working with mercury, emphasizing its role as the fundamental material of metallic transmutation.</p>
<p>The toxicity of mercury and its compounds, though recognized to some degree by ancient and medieval practitioners, was not fully appreciated until the early modern period. Mercury poisoning—causing tremors, psychological disturbances, and organ damage—affected many alchemists and artisans who worked extensively with the metal. Nevertheless, mercury preparations were used in medicine (particularly for treating syphilis) and in various industrial processes (gilding, mirror-making, hat-making). Modern chemistry understands mercury (Hg, atomic number 80) as a unique element whose liquid state at room temperature results from relativistic effects on its electron configuration. Lawrence Principe's research has shown how alchemical work with mercury contributed to the development of chemical techniques and theoretical understanding, even as it led to tragic cases of poisoning. The symbolic dimension of mercury—representing the volatile spirit, the transformative agent, the messenger between realms—made it perhaps the single most important substance in alchemical philosophy, embodying the principle of change, fluidity, and the capacity to penetrate and transform fixed matter.</p>
