# Style Guide: AlchemyDB Multimedia Dictionary

## 1. Objective
To provide a rigorous, multi-dimensional definition system that bridges **Historical Alchemical Theory** with **Modern Chemical Context**. The dictionary must serve as a "Scholarly Apparatus" rather than a mere list of terms.

## 2. Naming Conventions (The Dual-History Model)
To avoid teleological confusion, entries for substances, equipment, and processes must use disambiguation suffixes:

- **Substances**: `[Term] (alchemical)` and `[Term] (modern chemistry)`
  - *Example*: `Vitriol (alchemical)`, `Vitriol (modern chemistry)`
- **Equipment**: Use historical names (`Alembic`, `Cucurbit`) with functional cross-references.
- **Processes**: Use historical names (`Calcination`, `Cibation`) with modern chemical analogs.

## 3. Entry Structure (The "Rich Profile")
Every entry must contain:
1. **Core Definition**: A concise 1-2 sentence summary.
2. **Thematic Summary**: For alchemical entries, the symbolic or allegorical meaning.
3. **Material Basis**: For modern entries, the chemical formula and physical properties.
4. **Historical Synthesis**: A section titled "From Ars to Scientia" comparing the two views.
5. **Scholarly Citation**: Linking the entry to a specific anchor text (e.g., Principe, Newman, Obrist).

## 4. Tone and Voice
- **Tone**: Scholarly, objective, and relational.
- **Voice**: "Helpful Software Engineer collaborating with a Digital Humanities Professional."
- **Avoid**: Absolute binaries like "real science" vs. "fake magic." Use terms like "experimental provenance" and "epistemic status."

## 5. Visual Metadata
- **Alchemical Symbols**: Path to the historical glyph (e.g., `symbols/vitriol.png`).
- **Laboratory Schematics**: References to woodcuts or modern chemical diagrams.
- **Patronage Flags**: If a substance was part of a specific court project (e.g., "Medici Porcelain").
