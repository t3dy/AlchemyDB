Putrefaction</p>
<p>**Putrefaction** is the operation of allowing matter to decay or ferment in a sealed vessel, producing blackening and apparent corruption that was believed necessary for regeneration. In alchemical practice, putrefaction involved sealing materials in a vessel and maintaining gentle heat for an extended period, during which the matter would darken, sometimes liquefy, and undergo transformation. The operation was associated with the nigredo (blackening), the stage of death and dissolution that precedes regeneration. Putrefaction was considered essential by many alchemists, who cited the principle "nothing can be generated without corruption" (corruptio unius, generatio alterius).</p>
<p>The putrefaction operation typically involved sealing the philosophical matter (the conjoined sulfur and mercury, or other prepared materials) in a vessel, often the philosophical egg, and heating it gently in the athanor. Over time, the matter would darken, turning black as it putrefied. This blackening was taken as a sign that the operation was proceeding correctly: the old form was dying, the principles were being broken down to their fundamental state, preparing for their regeneration in perfected form. The putrefaction stage could last for weeks or months, requiring patient maintenance of gentle, constant heat. The appearance of blackness (the raven's head, the crow, the nigredo) indicated successful putrefaction.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, putrefaction represented death, decay, and the descent into darkness that precedes resurrection. The operation was associated with the tomb, with burial, with the death of the king, and with the nigredo stage of the work. Putrefaction was necessary to break down the old form completely, to reduce matter to the prima materia or chaos from which new life could emerge. The blackening represented the darkest stage of the work, the moment of greatest dissolution and apparent failure, but it was also the necessary precursor to the whitening (albedo) and the eventual perfection of the Stone. Putrefaction was associated with the element of earth, with Saturn (the dark, leaden planet), and with themes of death, burial, and the tomb. Putrefaction thus represents both the practical operation of fermentation and decay, and the symbolic operation of death and dissolution necessary for regeneration.</p>
