Artis Auriferae</p>
<p>**The Artis Auriferae** (The Art of Gold-Making, 1572) is an important anthology of alchemical texts published in Basel, collecting twenty-two treatises on the theory and practice of making the Philosopher's Stone. Compiled and published by Pietro Perna, a Protestant printer who specialized in controversial and esoteric works, the *Artis Auriferae* brought together influential medieval and Renaissance alchemical texts, including the *Turba Philosophorum*, the *Rosarium Philosophorum*, works attributed to Arnald of Villanova and Ramon Llull, and texts by more recent authors. The anthology was reprinted and expanded in subsequent editions, becoming one of the most important collections of alchemical literature before the larger *Theatrum Chemicum*.</p>
<p>The *Artis Auriferae* focused specifically on chrysopoeia—the making of gold—and the preparation of the Philosopher's Stone, collecting texts that presented both theoretical discussions of alchemical principles and practical instructions for laboratory operations. The anthology included some of the most influential alchemical texts of the medieval period, making them available in printed form to a wider audience. The *Rosarium Philosophorum*, with its famous series of emblematic images depicting the alchemical marriage and the stages of the work, appeared in the *Artis Auriferae* and became one of the most widely reproduced alchemical texts. The anthology's focus on practical alchemy and its inclusion of detailed operational instructions made it valuable for practitioners.</p>
<p>The publication of the *Artis Auriferae* in Basel, a center of Protestant printing and humanist scholarship, reflects the complex religious and intellectual context of sixteenth-century alchemy. Perna's press published works by Paracelsus, Giordano Bruno, and other controversial authors, and the *Artis Auriferae* participated in the dissemination of esoteric knowledge in the age of the Reformation. Modern scholarship has examined the *Artis Auriferae* as a publishing phenomenon and as a source for understanding the transmission of alchemical texts. The anthology represents the early modern effort to collect and preserve alchemical knowledge, making the wisdom of past masters available to contemporary practitioners and establishing a canon of authoritative texts.</p>
