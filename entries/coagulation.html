Coagulation</p>
<p>**Coagulation** is the operation of solidifying or fixing a liquid or volatile substance, transforming the fluid into the solid, the volatile into the fixed. In alchemical practice, coagulation was used to crystallize dissolved substances, to fix volatile spirits, to solidify oils or liquids, and to complete the transformation of matter from the fluid, chaotic state to the fixed, perfected state. Coagulation was often paired with dissolution in the alchemical maxim "solve et coagula" (dissolve and coagulate), representing the complementary operations of breaking down and building up, analysis and synthesis.</p>
<p>Coagulation could be achieved through various methods: cooling a hot saturated solution to allow crystals to form, evaporating solvent to concentrate a solution until it solidified, adding a coagulating agent to cause precipitation, or heating to drive off volatile components and leave a solid residue. The operation required careful control: too rapid coagulation might produce impure or poorly formed products, while properly controlled coagulation would produce pure, well-formed crystals or solids. Alchemists used coagulation to prepare salts from solutions, to fix mercury with sulfur, to solidify oils into waxes or solids, and to complete the final stage of the Great Work by fixing the volatile Stone into its permanent, solid form.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, coagulation represented the fixation of the volatile, the embodiment of spirit, the completion of the work. After the repeated operations of dissolution, distillation, and purification, the final coagulation fixed the purified principles into the perfected Stone. The operation was associated with the element of earth (the solid, fixed state), with downward movement and descent, with crystallization and solidification. Coagulation represented the return from the fluid, potential state to the solid, actual state, but now in perfected form. The Stone, having been dissolved, purified, and exalted, is finally coagulated into its permanent form, capable of performing transmutation. Coagulation thus represents both the practical operation of solidifying substances and the symbolic operation of fixing the volatile spirit into permanent, perfected matter.</p>
