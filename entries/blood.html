Blood</p>
<p>**Blood** (Lat. *sanguis*) held profound significance in alchemy, both as a practical laboratory material and as a potent symbol of life, sacrifice, and transformation. In laboratory practice, blood (usually from animals, though some texts mention human blood) was used in various operations: it was calcined to produce a black powder, it was distilled to extract volatile spirits and oils, and it was used in putrefaction processes. The *Rosarium Philosophorum* and other texts mention "dragon's blood" (sometimes actual blood, sometimes the red resin from *Dracaena* trees, sometimes cinnabar or other red substances), while Paracelsian texts describe preparing medicines from blood and using it in various iatrochemical operations.</p>
<p>The symbolic significance of blood in alchemy was multilayered and profound. Blood represented life itself, the vital principle that animated matter. The "blood of the metals" or "blood of the stone" referred to the red tincture or elixir produced in the final stage of the work, capable of transmuting base metals into gold and conferring health or immortality. In Christian alchemical allegory, the reddening (rubedo) of the stone was associated with Christ's blood, the Passion, and redemptive sacrifice. The pelican—a bird that was believed to feed its young with its own blood—became a symbol of both Christ's sacrifice and the alchemical vessel in which the work was perfected. Some alchemical texts describe the stone itself as "living blood" or as containing the "blood of the world," the universal life principle.</p>
<p>Modern biochemistry understands blood as a complex fluid containing cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets) suspended in plasma, which itself contains water, proteins, salts, and numerous other compounds. The historical use of blood in alchemy reflects both its practical properties (it contains iron, proteins, and other substances that undergo visible transformations when heated) and its profound symbolic resonance. The substance's red color, its association with life and death, and its role in sacrifice and renewal made it central to alchemical allegory, where the transformation of matter was inseparable from themes of death, resurrection, and the redemption of fallen nature. Blood thus represents the meeting point of material practice and spiritual symbolism, embodying the alchemical conviction that physical and spiritual transformation are parallel processes.</p>
