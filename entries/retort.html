Retort</p>
<p>**The retort** is a vessel with a long curved neck used for distillation, one of the most essential pieces of alchemical apparatus. The retort's distinctive shape—a bulbous body with a downward-curving neck—allowed vapors produced by heating materials in the body to condense in the neck and drip into a receiving vessel. Retorts were made from various materials including glass, earthenware, and metal, with glass retorts being preferred for observing the process and for working with corrosive substances. The retort appears constantly in alchemical texts and illustrations, often depicted as the vessel in which crucial transformations occur, and it became an iconic symbol of alchemical and chemical practice.</p>
<p>The retort's design facilitated the separation of volatile from fixed substances, a fundamental alchemical operation. By heating materials in the retort's body, volatile components would vaporize, travel through the curved neck, condense, and collect in a receiver, while non-volatile residues remained in the body. This process was used to prepare various substances including spirits (volatile liquids), oils, and quintessences. Alchemists used retorts for distilling mercury, preparing acids, extracting essences from plants and minerals, and performing operations related to the preparation of the Philosopher's Stone. The retort's curved neck prevented materials from being carried over mechanically during vigorous boiling, ensuring purer distillates.</p>
<p>Alchemical texts frequently describe operations performed in retorts, sometimes using symbolic language: the retort might be called the "philosophical egg" or the "vessel of Hermes," and the materials within it might be described as the king and queen undergoing their chemical marriage. The retort's sealed nature made it suitable for operations requiring containment of vapors or prevention of air contact. Modern scholarship on the history of chemistry has examined the development of distillation apparatus and the retort's role in both alchemical practice and the emergence of chemical technology. The retort thus represents the essential alchemical vessel that enabled the separation and purification of substances, a tool that bridged practical chemistry and symbolic transformation.</p>
