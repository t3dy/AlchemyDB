Dephlegmator</p>
<p>**The dephlegmator** is a device for separating phlegm (water or other low-boiling components) from spirits or oils during distillation. The apparatus typically consists of a cooled section between the cucurbit and the alembic, where water vapors condense and return to the cucurbit while more volatile components pass through to the alembic. This allows for the separation of alcohol or essential oils from water, producing more concentrated distillates. The dephlegmator represents a refinement of simple distillation apparatus, demonstrating increasing sophistication in separation techniques.</p>
<p>The dephlegmator could be constructed in various ways: a water-cooled section of tubing, a chamber with cooling coils, or a section of the apparatus exposed to air for cooling. The key principle is that the dephlegmator is cooler than the vapor source but warmer than the final condenser, allowing selective condensation of higher-boiling components while lower-boiling components pass through. Alchemists used dephlegmators to prepare concentrated spirits (high-proof alcohol), to separate essential oils from water in plant distillations, and to purify various distilled products.</p>
<p>The dephlegmator represents the principle of fractional separation, the idea that complex mixtures can be separated into components based on their different properties. The removal of phlegm (considered the watery, inactive component) to concentrate the spirit (the active, volatile component) had both practical and symbolic significance. In alchemical philosophy, the separation of the subtle from the gross, the active from the passive, was a fundamental operation. The dephlegmator thus represents both a practical apparatus for improving distillation and the principle of separating and concentrating the active principles.</p>
