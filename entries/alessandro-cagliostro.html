Alessandro Cagliostro</p>
<p>**Alessandro, Count of Cagliostro** (Giuseppe Balsamo, 1743–1795) was an Italian adventurer, occultist, and self-proclaimed alchemist who became one of the most famous (and infamous) figures of late eighteenth-century European esotericism. Cagliostro traveled throughout Europe, establishing Masonic lodges, performing apparent miracles, selling alchemical elixirs, and claiming possession of alchemical secrets. He became involved in the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, a scandal that damaged the reputation of the French monarchy, and was eventually imprisoned by the Inquisition in Rome, where he died. Cagliostro represents the transformation of alchemy into popular occultism and the association of alchemy with fraud and charlatanism.</p>
<p>Cagliostro claimed to possess the secrets of physical and spiritual regeneration, offering elixirs that would restore youth and health. He established "Egyptian Masonry," a variant of Freemasonry that incorporated alchemical and hermetic elements. Cagliostro performed apparent healings and demonstrations of alchemical transmutation, though many contemporaries suspected fraud. He cultivated an air of mystery, claiming ancient wisdom and secret knowledge. His activities brought him both fame and notoriety, with some viewing him as a genuine adept and others as a clever charlatan.</p>
<p>Cagliostro's significance lies in his representation of alchemy's decline in the Age of Enlightenment. As chemistry emerged as a rational science, alchemy increasingly became associated with fraud, superstition, and charlatanism. Cagliostro's spectacular career and dramatic downfall contributed to this association. However, he also represents the continuation of esoteric and occult traditions that would reemerge in the nineteenth-century occult revival. Cagliostro became a legendary figure in esoteric literature, with some later occultists defending him as a genuine adept persecuted by the establishment. He represents the transformation of alchemy from a serious natural philosophical pursuit into popular occultism and entertainment.</p>
