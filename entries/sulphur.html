Sulphur</p>
<p>**Sulphur** (Lat. *sulphur*; alchemical symbol 🜍) is one of the two fundamental principles of medieval alchemical theory, paired with Mercury to explain the composition and transformation of metals. In the influential *Summa Perfectionis* (late 13th century), attributed to Geber but likely composed by the Latin alchemist Paul of Taranto, Sulphur represents the combustible, fixed, and masculine principle within metallic bodies, while Mercury embodies the volatile, fluid, and feminine aspect. All metals were believed to be generated in the earth through the combination of these two principles in varying degrees of purity: gold resulted from the perfect union of pure Sulphur and pure Mercury, while base metals like lead and copper suffered from impurities or imbalances in their sulphurous and mercurial components. The alchemist's task was therefore to purify and rebalance these principles, either by removing impure Sulphur from base metals or by introducing perfected Sulphur (often identified with the Philosopher's Stone itself) to complete the transmutation.</p>
<p>The Paracelsian revolution of the sixteenth century transformed Sulphur from a two-principle into a three-principle system by adding Salt as a third fundamental component. In Paracelsus's *tria prima* doctrine, Sulphur became specifically associated with the soul (*anima*) and the combustible essence of substances—that which burns and gives color. This triadic system was elaborated by Paracelsian followers like Oswald Croll and Joseph Duchesne, who developed complex theories about how the three principles manifested differently in the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms. The practical consequence was a shift in laboratory focus: rather than seeking to purify common sulphur (the yellow mineral), iatrochemists attempted to extract the "essential Sulphur" from various substances through distillation and calcination, producing oils, resins, and other combustible materials that they identified as the sulphurous principle.</p>
<p>Modern chemical understanding has revealed both the insights and limitations of alchemical Sulphur theory. The mineral sulphur (*S*) is indeed a component of many metal ores (as sulfides), and the roasting of these ores—a process alchemists called "removing the combustible Sulphur"—was a genuine metallurgical technique for extracting metals. William Newman's research has shown that medieval alchemists developed sophisticated methods for manipulating sulphur compounds, including the preparation of sulfuric acid (oil of vitriol) and various sulfides and sulfates. However, the theoretical identification of Sulphur as a universal principle led to conceptual confusions that persisted until Lavoisier's chemical revolution definitively demonstrated that sulphur was an element, not a principle. Nevertheless, the alchemical concept of Sulphur as an active, transformative agent contributed to early modern chemical theory, particularly in debates about combustion, calcination, and the nature of chemical composition. The principle's symbolic associations—with fire, the sun, masculinity, and the soul—also made it central to alchemical allegory and spiritual interpretation, where the purification of Sulphur represented the refinement of the passionate, active aspect of the self.</p>
