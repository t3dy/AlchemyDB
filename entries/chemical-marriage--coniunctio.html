Chemical Marriage (Coniunctio)</p>
<p>**The Chemical Marriage** (coniunctio) is the union of opposites, particularly the marriage of the Red King and White Queen, sulfur and mercury, sun and moon, masculine and feminine. The Chemical Marriage is one of the most important and frequently depicted operations in alchemical allegory, representing the conjunction of purified principles that generates the philosophical child, the hermaphrodite or rebis that will mature into the Philosopher's Stone. The marriage symbolizes that perfection arises not from the dominance of one principle but from the harmonious union of complementary opposites.</p>
<p>The Chemical Marriage is depicted in alchemical emblems in various ways: the Red King and White Queen standing together or lying in bed, the union of sun and moon, the conjunction of sulfur and mercury in the philosophical vessel, or the hermaphroditic rebis that results from the union. The marriage must be preceded by the purification of both partners: the sulfur must be calcined, purified, and fixed, while the mercury must be distilled, sublimed, and exalted. Only when both principles are properly prepared can their union be fruitful. The marriage occurs in the sealed vessel, the philosophical egg, where the purified principles are combined and subjected to gentle heat, allowing them to unite and generate the philosophical child.</p>
<p>In alchemical philosophy, the Chemical Marriage represents the fundamental principle that perfection arises from the union of opposites. The marriage of masculine and feminine, active and passive, fixed and volatile, hot and cold, creates a new being that transcends both parents while containing both. The Chemical Marriage is associated with themes of love, generation, and creation: just as biological generation requires the union of male and female, so the generation of the Stone requires the union of sulfur and mercury. The marriage also represents the reconciliation of opposites, the achievement of harmony and balance, the integration of complementary principles. The Chemical Marriage thus represents both the literal operation of combining purified sulfur and mercury and the philosophical principle that perfection arises from the harmonious union of opposites.</p>
