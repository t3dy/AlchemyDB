Fermentation</p>
<p>**Fermentation** is the operation of introducing a ferment or tincture into the conjoined matter to animate it and give it the power of multiplication. In alchemical practice, fermentation followed conjunction: after the principles had been united, a small amount of perfected matter (the ferment) was added to animate the mass and give it life. The term was borrowed from the familiar process of bread-making or wine-making, where a small amount of leaven or yeast transforms a larger mass. In alchemy, fermentation represented the stage where the Stone, having been prepared, is given its final perfection and its power to transmute base metals.</p>
<p>The fermentation operation involved adding a small quantity of gold (for the red Stone) or silver (for the white Stone) to the prepared matter. This noble metal acted as a ferment, communicating its perfection to the entire mass and enabling the Stone to transmute base metals into gold or silver. Some texts describe two fermentations: the first with the white Stone and silver, producing the white tincture capable of transmuting metals to silver; the second with the red Stone and gold, producing the red tincture capable of transmuting metals to gold. The fermented Stone was believed to have the power of multiplication: a small amount could transmute a much larger quantity of base metal, and the Stone itself could be multiplied by repeating the operations with the Stone as the starting material.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, fermentation represented the animation of matter, the infusion of spirit into body, the resurrection of the dead. Just as leaven causes bread to rise and yeast causes wine to ferment, so the philosophical ferment causes the Stone to come alive and acquire its transformative power. Fermentation was associated with the color yellow or citrine (the stage between white and red), with putrefaction and regeneration, and with the theme of resurrection. The operation represented the transition from the prepared but inactive Stone to the living, active Stone capable of performing transmutation. Fermentation thus represents both the practical operation of adding a ferment to activate matter and the symbolic operation of infusing life and power into the perfected substance.</p>
