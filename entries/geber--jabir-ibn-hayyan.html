Geber (Jabir ibn Hayyan)</p>
<p>**Geber** is the Latinized name of Jabir ibn Hayyan, to whom an extensive Arabic alchemical corpus was attributed, and also the pseudonymous author of the influential Latin *Summa Perfectionis* (Sum of Perfection) and related texts composed in the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century. The historical Jabir, if he existed, was an eighth-century figure associated with the Shi'ite imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, but the Arabic Jabirian corpus (comprising hundreds of works) was likely composed over several centuries by multiple authors. The Latin Geber corpus, particularly the *Summa Perfectionis*, was long thought to be a translation from Arabic but is now recognized as an original Latin composition that drew on Arabic alchemical sources while developing its own systematic theory and practice. The *Summa* presents a comprehensive account of alchemical theory based on the sulfur-mercury theory of metallic generation, describes the properties and preparation of various substances, and outlines procedures for attempting transmutation.</p>
<p>The *Summa Perfectionis* became one of the most influential alchemical texts in the Latin West, studied and cited continuously from the fourteenth through the seventeenth centuries. Its systematic presentation of alchemical theory, its detailed practical instructions, and its critical approach to earlier alchemical claims made it a foundational text for both practitioners and natural philosophers. The work discusses the generation of metals in the earth from sulfur and mercury, the possibility of artificial transmutation through the perfection of these principles, and the operations (calcination, solution, separation, etc.) required to prepare the Philosopher's Stone. The author demonstrates knowledge of practical chemistry, describing the preparation and properties of mineral acids, salts, and metallic compounds with considerable accuracy.</p>
<p>Modern scholarship, particularly the groundbreaking work of William Newman, has established the Latin Geber corpus as an original medieval composition rather than a translation, and has analyzed its sophisticated chemical knowledge and its influence on the development of medieval and early modern chemistry. The *Summa* represents medieval alchemy at its most systematic and empirically grounded, combining theoretical sophistication with practical knowledge. The attribution to Geber/Jabir gave the text authority by linking it to the prestigious Arabic alchemical tradition, while the actual content represented the state of Latin alchemical knowledge in the late thirteenth century. Geber thus exemplifies both the transmission of Arabic alchemical learning to the Latin West and the creative transformation of that learning into new systematic works that shaped European alchemy for centuries.</p>
