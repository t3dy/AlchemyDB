Tribikos</p>
<p>**The tribikos** is a three-armed distillation apparatus attributed to Maria the Jewess, consisting of a cucurbit (body vessel) with three alembic heads or arms extending from it. The three arms allowed for simultaneous collection of distillate in three different receivers, either for collecting larger quantities or for separating different fractions. The tribikos represents an early example of sophisticated distillation apparatus design, demonstrating the technical ingenuity of Hellenistic alchemists. The apparatus is described in the writings of Zosimos and other early alchemical authors, and it became emblematic of Maria the Jewess's contributions to alchemical technology.</p>
<p>The tribikos could be used for various purposes: the three receivers might collect the same distillate (increasing capacity), or they might collect different fractions coming over at different times or temperatures. The apparatus demonstrates understanding of fractional distillation and the possibility of separating complex mixtures into components. The tribikos's design influenced later distillation apparatus, and the principle of multiple collection points was incorporated into more complex stills. The apparatus appears in medieval and Renaissance alchemical illustrations, often in depictions of Maria the Jewess or in diagrams of alchemical apparatus.</p>
<p>The tribikos represents the technical sophistication of early alchemy and the importance of apparatus design for successful operations. The three arms might also have symbolic significance: the number three appears frequently in alchemical symbolism (three principles, three stages of the work, the Trinity), and the tribikos's three-fold structure could represent the division of the one into three or the collection of three principles. The tribikos thus represents both an innovative practical apparatus and a symbol of the technical and symbolic dimensions of alchemical practice.</p>
