Ouroboros</p>
<p>**The Ouroboros** is the ancient symbol of a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, forming a circle. This image appears in alchemical texts as a representation of cyclical processes, eternal return, the unity of all things, and the self-sufficient nature of the alchemical work. The Ouroboros symbolizes that the end returns to the beginning, that the work is circular rather than linear, and that the Stone contains within itself everything necessary for its own generation and multiplication. The symbol appears in Greek alchemical texts, in medieval and Renaissance alchemical manuscripts, and continues as a powerful emblem of alchemical philosophy.</p>
<p>The Ouroboros represents several key alchemical concepts. As a circle, it symbolizes perfection, completion, and the eternal. The serpent eating its tail represents the cyclical nature of alchemical operations: distillation and condensation, volatilization and fixation, dissolution and coagulation, each operation leading back to its opposite in endless cycles. The symbol also represents the principle "one is all" (hen to pan), the idea that all things arise from and return to the one prima materia. The Ouroboros eating itself suggests that the work is self-contained, that the Stone generates itself from itself, that the end product contains the seed of its own multiplication.</p>
<p>In alchemical philosophy, the Ouroboros embodies the paradoxical nature of the work: the Stone is both the beginning and the end, the matter and the product, the seed and the fruit. The symbol represents the circulation of the philosophical matter, the repeated cycles of operations that gradually perfect the Stone. The Ouroboros also symbolizes the unity of opposites: the serpent is both one and many, both devouring and devoured, both beginning and end. The symbol connects to the broader alchemical theme of cyclical time, the idea that transformation occurs through repeated cycles rather than linear progress. The Ouroboros thus represents the self-sufficient, cyclical, and paradoxical nature of the alchemical work, the principle that the end is contained in the beginning and that perfection arises through eternal return.</p>
