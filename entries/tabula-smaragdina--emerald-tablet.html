Tabula Smaragdina (Emerald Tablet)</p>
<p>**The Tabula Smaragdina** (Emerald Tablet) is the most famous and influential alchemical text, a brief cryptic statement attributed to Hermes Trismegistus that became the foundational text of alchemical philosophy. The earliest known version appears in Arabic in the *Sirr al-khalīqa* (Secret of Creation), attributed to Apollonius of Tyana but likely composed in the eighth or ninth century. The text was translated into Latin in the twelfth century and circulated widely in medieval and Renaissance Europe, appearing in countless alchemical manuscripts and printed books. The Tablet's most famous dictum—"That which is below is like that which is above, and that which is above is like that which is below, to accomplish the miracles of one thing"—became the cornerstone of alchemical cosmology, expressing the principle of correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm, heaven and earth, spirit and matter.</p>
<p>The Emerald Tablet's thirteen brief statements describe the generation of all things from the One, the role of the Sun and Moon as father and mother, the power of the wind (air) and earth in carrying and nourishing the "one thing," and the separation of earth from fire and subtle from gross. Alchemists interpreted these cryptic phrases as containing the secret of the Philosopher's Stone: the "one thing" was understood as the prima materia or the Stone itself, while the operations described (separation, conjunction, ascent and descent) were read as instructions for the alchemical work. The text's concluding claim—"Thus I am called Hermes Trismegistus, having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world"—established Hermes as the legendary founder of alchemy and linked the art to ancient Egyptian wisdom.</p>
<p>The Emerald Tablet generated an enormous commentary tradition, with alchemists from the medieval period through the early modern era writing elaborate interpretations that attempted to decode its meaning. Commentators including Roger Bacon (in texts attributed to him), Albertus Magnus (in spurious works), and later figures like Hortulanus (fourteenth century) produced detailed glosses that explained each phrase in terms of alchemical theory and practice. Modern scholarship has examined the Tablet's origins, its transmission from Arabic to Latin, and its role in shaping alchemical philosophy. The text represents the quintessence of alchemical symbolism: brief, cryptic, claiming ancient authority, and capable of supporting endless interpretation. The Emerald Tablet thus stands as the most concise and influential statement of alchemical principles, a text whose few words inspired centuries of practice and speculation.</p>
