Hermetic Seal</p>
<p>**The hermetic seal** is a method of completely sealing a vessel to prevent any exchange of materials or vapors with the outside environment. The term "hermetic" derives from Hermes Trismegistus, the legendary founder of alchemy, and hermetic sealing became essential for operations requiring complete containment. The seal was typically achieved by heating the neck of a glass vessel until it softened and then drawing it closed, creating a permanent seal. Alternatively, vessels could be sealed with lutes (pastes made from various materials) or with ground glass joints, though these were less perfectly hermetic.</p>
<p>Hermetic sealing was crucial for operations where the alchemist needed to prevent the escape of volatile substances, to exclude air, or to maintain a closed system for circulation or digestion. The sealed vessel became a microcosm, a self-contained world where transformations could occur without external interference. Alchemists believed that certain operations required complete sealing to succeed: the philosophical egg, the vessel containing the prima materia undergoing transformation, had to be hermetically sealed to prevent the escape of the volatile spirit and to maintain the proper balance of elements within.</p>
<p>The hermetic seal had profound symbolic significance. The sealed vessel represented the cosmos, the womb, the tomb, and the vessel of transformation. The requirement for hermetic sealing emphasized that the alchemical work was a closed, self-contained process, that the transformation occurred through the interaction of principles already present within the vessel rather than through addition of external materials. The phrase "hermetically sealed" entered common language to mean completely closed or airtight, testament to the importance of this concept. The hermetic seal thus represents both a practical technique for containment and a fundamental principle of alchemical philosophy: that transformation occurs within a closed system through the interaction of internal principles.</p>
