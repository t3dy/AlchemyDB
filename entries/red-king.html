Red King</p>
<p>**The Red King** is a central figure in alchemical allegory, representing the masculine, solar, sulfuric principle in its perfected state. The Red King appears in alchemical emblems as a crowned monarch dressed in red, often holding solar symbols or standing on the sun. He represents gold, the sun among metals, the fixed and incorruptible principle, and the masculine aspect of the philosophical matter. The Red King is frequently paired with the White Queen (representing silver, the moon, mercury, and the feminine principle), and their union through the chemical marriage is essential to generating the Philosopher's Stone.</p>
<p>The Red King's attributes emphasize his solar, masculine, active nature. His red color represents the rubedo stage of the work, the final reddening that produces the red Stone capable of transmuting base metals to gold. His crown signifies his royal nature, his perfection and sovereignty among the metals. His association with the sun connects him to gold, to the element of fire, to the active and generative principle. In the chemical marriage, the Red King represents the fixed sulfur that must unite with the volatile mercury (the White Queen) to generate the philosophical child, the Stone that combines the virtues of both parents.</p>
<p>In alchemical philosophy, the Red King represents the perfected masculine principle, the solar sulfur that has been purified and exalted through the operations of the work. He embodies the qualities of fixity, permanence, heat, dryness, and activity. His union with the White Queen represents the conjunction of opposites necessary for generation: masculine and feminine, sun and moon, sulfur and mercury, fixed and volatile, hot and cold. The chemical marriage of the Red King and White Queen, depicted in countless alchemical emblems, symbolizes the fundamental alchemical principle that perfection arises from the proper union of complementary opposites. The Red King thus represents both the perfected gold that serves as the seed of the Stone and the masculine principle that must unite with the feminine to generate new life.</p>
