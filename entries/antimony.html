Antimony</p>
<p>**Antimony** (Lat. *stibium*; alchemical symbol ♁) is a brittle, silvery-white metalloid that became central to early modern alchemical debate, particularly through the writings attributed to Basil Valentine. In medieval Latin alchemy, antimony was known primarily as a purgative medicine and a means of purifying gold, its ability to separate noble from base metals earning it the epithet "the wolf of metals" (*lupus metallorum*). The *Triumphal Chariot of Antimony* (c. 1604), pseudonymously attributed to the legendary Benedictine monk Basil Valentine, elevated antimony to near-miraculous status, claiming it could cure plague, leprosy, and all manner of diseases when properly prepared. This text sparked fierce controversy between Paracelsian iatrochemists, who championed antimony's medicinal virtues, and Galenist physicians, who considered it a dangerous poison—a debate that raged across European medical faculties well into the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Modern scholarship, particularly the work of William Newman and Lawrence Principe, has demonstrated that antimony's alchemical significance lay not in mystical symbolism but in its remarkable chemical properties: its ability to form a "regulus" (a purified metallic button) that could serve as an intermediate in transmutational processes. The famous "star of antimony" (*stella antimonii*), a crystalline pattern that forms when molten antimony cools, was interpreted by alchemists as a sign of the metal's celestial virtue. Recent analysis of laboratory notebooks from figures like George Starkey reveals that antimony-based processes were among the most carefully guarded "arcana" of seventeenth-century chrysopoeia, with practitioners developing sophisticated techniques for extracting what they believed to be antimony's "philosophical mercury." The metal's dual nature—simultaneously poisonous and curative, destructive and purifying—made it a perfect emblem of the alchemical principle that transformation requires the violent dissolution of the old before the new can emerge.</p>
