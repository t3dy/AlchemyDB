Cohobation</p>
<p>**Cohobation** is the operation of repeatedly distilling a liquid and pouring the distillate back over the residue, then distilling again. The term derives from Arabic, and the operation was used to extract maximum virtues from materials, to concentrate essences, and to promote thorough extraction through repeated distillation. Cohobation differed from simple circulation in that the distillate was collected and then poured back over the residue, rather than returning automatically through the apparatus. The operation was particularly used in preparing quintessences and in extracting essences from plant materials.</p>
<p>The cohobation operation involved distilling a mixture (such as alcohol and plant material), collecting the distillate, then pouring it back over the residue in the cucurbit and distilling again. This process would be repeated multiple times (three, seven, or more cohobations), with each cycle extracting more of the desired essence. The repeated contact between the distilled spirit and the residue allowed for thorough extraction of virtues. Cohobation was used to prepare strong tinctures, to extract essential oils, and to concentrate the active principles of materials. The operation could be combined with fresh additions of material, or performed with the same material throughout.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, cohobation represented the repeated working of spirit upon body, the continuous extraction and concentration of virtues through cyclical operations. The operation embodied the principle that perfection requires repeated effort, that essences are extracted gradually through patient repetition rather than in a single operation. Cohobation was associated with themes of persistence, repetition, and the gradual concentration of power through repeated cycles. The operation represented the alchemical conviction that the work required time and patience, that the Stone was perfected through repeated operations rather than sudden transformation. Cohobation thus represents both the practical operation of repeated distillation with return of distillate, and the symbolic operation of gradual extraction and concentration through patient repetition.</p>
