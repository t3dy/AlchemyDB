Albertus Magnus</p>
<p>**Albertus Magnus** (Albert the Great, c. 1200-1280) was a Dominican friar, theologian, and natural philosopher whose encyclopedic works on natural philosophy included significant discussions of alchemy, mineralogy, and the properties of metals and minerals. Teaching at Paris and Cologne, Albertus became one of the most influential scholars of the thirteenth century, earning the epithet "Doctor Universalis" for the breadth of his learning. His authentic works on minerals and metals—particularly the *De mineralibus* (On Minerals)—demonstrate careful observation and a critical approach to alchemical claims, distinguishing between genuine transmutation (which he doubted was possible through art) and the production of convincing imitations. However, numerous alchemical treatises were falsely attributed to him in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance, including the *Semita recta* and the *Libellus de alchimia*, which enjoyed wide circulation and contributed to his posthumous reputation as a master alchemist.</p>
<p>Albertus's genuine writings on minerals reveal a sophisticated understanding of geological processes, the classification of stones and metals, and the properties of various substances. He discussed the formation of metals in the earth according to the sulfur-mercury theory, the testing and identification of minerals, and the practical uses of various substances in medicine and the arts. His critical attitude toward alchemical transmutation—he acknowledged that alchemists could produce substances that resembled gold in appearance but doubted they could replicate its essential nature—represented an important philosophical position that influenced later debates. The *De mineralibus* drew on classical sources (particularly Aristotle's *Meteorology*), Arabic authorities (especially Avicenna), and Albertus's own observations, creating a synthesis that became foundational for medieval mineralogy.</p>
<p>The spurious alchemical works attributed to Albertus circulated widely and shaped his posthumous reputation more than his authentic writings. These pseudonymous texts presented him as a successful practitioner of chrysopoeia and as an authority on alchemical secrets, contributing to a tradition that linked Dominican learning with alchemical knowledge. Modern scholarship, particularly the work of William Newman, has carefully distinguished Albertus's authentic contributions to mineralogy and natural philosophy from the later alchemical forgeries, revealing both his genuine influence on the study of minerals and the processes by which medieval scholars became posthumously transformed into alchemical authorities. Albertus Magnus thus represents the complex relationship between scholastic natural philosophy and alchemy, and the ways in which intellectual authority could be appropriated and transformed through pseudonymous attribution.</p>
