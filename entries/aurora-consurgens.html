Aurora Consurgens</p>
<p>**The Aurora Consurgens** (Rising Dawn) is a late medieval alchemical text attributed to Thomas Aquinas but actually composed in the thirteenth or fourteenth century, combining alchemical allegory with biblical quotations and mystical imagery. The text exists in two parts: a prose section that presents alchemical theory and practice through elaborate allegorical narratives, and a verse section that uses erotic and mystical language to describe the alchemical work. The *Aurora* is remarkable for its extensive use of biblical quotations, particularly from the Song of Songs and the Wisdom literature, which are reinterpreted as alchemical allegories. The text personifies the Philosopher's Stone as a divine woman or bride, drawing on the biblical figure of Wisdom (Sophia) and the bride of the Song of Songs.</p>
<p>The prose *Aurora* presents a series of allegorical narratives: the king and queen who must be united, the old man who is rejuvenated, the woman clothed with the sun, and other symbolic figures drawn from biblical, classical, and alchemical sources. These narratives describe the stages of the alchemical work through symbolic imagery, with the marriage of king and queen representing the conjunction of sulfur and mercury, the death and resurrection of the king representing the nigredo and albedo, and the birth of the divine child representing the perfected Stone. The text's use of biblical language sanctifies the alchemical work, presenting it as a sacred mystery parallel to the mysteries of faith.</p>
<p>The illustrated manuscripts of the *Aurora Consurgens* feature striking images that visualize the text's allegories: the alchemical couple in various poses, the philosophical tree bearing sun and moon fruits, the fountain of life, and other symbolic scenes. These images influenced later alchemical iconography and contributed to the development of alchemical emblematic literature. Modern scholarship, particularly the work of Marie-Louise von Franz (who produced a Jungian psychological interpretation) and Barbara Obrist (who examined the text's medieval context), has recognized the *Aurora Consurgens* as a significant example of the spiritualization of alchemy and the use of religious imagery to express alchemical ideas. The *Aurora* thus represents the medieval Christian alchemical tradition that found in biblical texts hidden alchemical meanings, and that understood the transformation of metals as parallel to the transformation of the soul.</p>
