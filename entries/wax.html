Wax</p>
<p>**Wax** (beeswax; Lat. *cera*) was used extensively in alchemy, pharmacy, and various crafts for its moldability, its ability to form seals, and its combustible properties. In alchemical practice, wax served multiple functions: it was used to seal vessels (ensuring airtight closure for operations requiring hermetic sealing), to make models and molds (particularly in lost-wax casting of metals), to prepare ointments and salves (wax serves as a base that holds medicinal ingredients), and as a component in certain preparations. The *Mappae Clavicula* and other technical texts describe using wax in gilding, in preparing artificial gems, in sealing, and in various pharmaceutical formulations.</p>
<p>The symbolic significance of wax in alchemy derived from its malleability and its transformation when heated. Wax could be molded into any shape, symbolizing the plasticity of matter and its capacity to receive form. When heated, wax melts and can be reformed, exemplifying the alchemical principle that matter must be dissolved before it can be reconstituted in a new, perfected form. The lost-wax casting process—where a wax model is encased in clay, the wax is melted out, and molten metal is poured into the cavity—provided a powerful metaphor for alchemical transformation: the destruction of the old form (the wax) enables the creation of the new (the metal casting). Some alchemical texts use wax as a metaphor for the prima materia or for the soul, capable of receiving any impression or form.</p>
<p>Modern chemistry understands beeswax as primarily composed of long-chain hydrocarbons (particularly esters of fatty acids and alcohols), which explains its properties: it melts at a relatively low temperature (around 62-64°C), it is hydrophobic (water-repellent), and it burns cleanly. The substance's traditional uses in sealing, molding, and pharmacy were based on genuine properties that made it valuable across multiple domains. Wax thus represents how a natural product could serve both practical and symbolic functions, embodying alchemical themes of malleability, transformation through heat, and the capacity of matter to receive and hold form. The substance's role in lost-wax casting particularly resonated with alchemical philosophy, providing a tangible demonstration of how destruction and creation, dissolution and coagulation, are complementary aspects of transformation.</p>
