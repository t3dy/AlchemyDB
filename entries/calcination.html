Calcination</p>
<p>**Calcination** is the operation of heating a substance to high temperature to drive off volatile components, oxidize metals, or reduce materials to powder or ash. The term derives from Latin *calx* (lime), referring to the calcination of limestone to produce quicklime. In alchemical practice, calcination was used to prepare metals and minerals for further operations, to remove impurities, and to transform substances into more reactive forms. The operation had both practical applications (preparing materials for chemical processes) and symbolic significance (representing purification through fire, the reduction of matter to its essential nature, and the death that precedes resurrection).</p>
<p>Calcination was performed in crucibles, cupels, or other heat-resistant vessels placed in furnaces capable of achieving high temperatures. Different materials required different degrees of heat: gentle calcination might be performed in a reverberatory furnace with moderate heat, while intense calcination required the fierce heat of a wind furnace or blast furnace. Metals calcined in air would form oxides (calces): lead produced litharge or minium, copper produced verdigris or other copper oxides, iron produced rust. These calces were often more reactive than the original metals and could be used in various alchemical operations. Calcination could also refer to the reduction of materials to ash through burning, as in the calcination of plant materials to produce alkaline ashes.</p>
<p>In alchemical philosophy, calcination represented the first operation of the Great Work, the initial purification through fire. The reduction of matter to ash or powder symbolized the death of the old form, the mortification necessary before regeneration. Calcination destroyed the superficial qualities of matter, revealing its inner nature. The operation was associated with the element of fire, with the color black (nigredo), and with the astrological sign of Aries. Alchemical texts describe calcination in both literal and symbolic terms, sometimes referring to actual heating operations and sometimes to spiritual purification. Modern scholarship has examined calcination in the context of early metallurgy and chemistry, recognizing it as a fundamental operation that contributed to understanding oxidation and chemical transformation. Calcination thus represents both a practical operation for preparing materials and a symbolic operation of purification and reduction to essentials.</p>
