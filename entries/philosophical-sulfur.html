Philosophical Sulfur</p>
<p>**Philosophical Sulfur** is not common brimstone but the purified, fixed principle that represents the soul, the tincture, and the masculine aspect of the philosophical matter. Philosophical Sulfur is the fixed, hot, dry principle that must unite with the volatile philosophical mercury to generate the Philosopher's Stone. Like philosophical mercury, philosophical sulfur is not the common sulfur of commerce, though it may be prepared from common sulfur or extracted from other materials through alchemical operations.</p>
<p>Philosophical Sulfur represents the soul or tincture of metals, the principle that gives them their color, their fixity, and their specific qualities. In the theory of metallic generation, all metals are composed of mercury and sulfur: the mercury provides the metallic body and volatility, while the sulfur provides the color, fixity, and specific nature. Gold, the most perfect metal, contains the most pure and perfectly balanced sulfur and mercury. Philosophical sulfur is this perfected sulfuric principle, extracted and purified through alchemical operations. It is the red tincture, the masculine seed, the fixed principle that imparts perfection to the volatile mercury.</p>
<p>In alchemical philosophy, Philosophical Sulfur represents the active, masculine, solar principle, the soul or essence that gives form and quality to matter. It embodies the qualities of fixity, permanence, heat, dryness, and activity. Philosophical sulfur is the seed that must be planted in the philosophical mercury (the womb), the tincture that colors and perfects the base matter, the soul that animates the body. The union of philosophical sulfur and philosophical mercury represents the marriage of opposites, the conjunction of active and passive, fixed and volatile, masculine and feminine. Philosophical Sulfur thus represents the universal principle of fixity, activity, and form, the soul or tincture that imparts specific qualities to matter.</p>
