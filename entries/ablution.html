Ablution</p>
<p>**Ablution** is the operation of washing or purifying matter, removing impurities through repeated washing with water or other solvents. In alchemical practice, ablution involved treating materials with liquids to dissolve and remove impurities, leaving the purified substance. The term derives from Latin *abluere* (to wash away), and the operation was used to purify salts, to cleanse calcined materials, to remove soluble impurities from insoluble substances, and to prepare materials for further operations. Ablution was associated with the element of water, with purification, and with the transition from the black nigredo to the white albedo.</p>
<p>Ablution could be performed in various ways: washing materials with water to dissolve and remove water-soluble impurities, washing with acidic or alkaline solutions to remove specific impurities, or repeatedly washing and decanting to achieve thorough purification. The operation often involved multiple washings: the material would be washed, the washing liquid decanted or filtered off, and the process repeated until the washings ran clear, indicating that impurities had been removed. Ablution was particularly important in preparing purified salts, where crude salts were dissolved in water, filtered to remove insoluble impurities, and then crystallized to produce pure salt. The operation could also refer to washing the blackened matter of the nigredo to produce the white matter of the albedo.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, ablution represented purification through water, the washing away of impurities, and the transition from blackness to whiteness. The operation was associated with baptism, with ritual purification, with the cleansing of sin, and with the whitening of the blackened matter. Ablution represented the principle that impurities could be removed through washing, that matter could be purified through the action of water. The operation was associated with the element of water, with the color white, with the moon, and with themes of purification, cleansing, and renewal. The washing of the black crow to produce the white swan or dove was a common alchemical image representing ablution. Ablution thus represents both the practical operation of washing to remove impurities and the symbolic operation of purification and transition from darkness to light.</p>
