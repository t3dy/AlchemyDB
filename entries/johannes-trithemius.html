Johannes Trithemius</p>
<p>**Johannes Trithemius** (1462-1516) was a German Benedictine abbot, historian, and occultist whose works on cryptography, angel magic, and the occult sciences influenced later Renaissance magic and alchemy, and whose students included Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus. Abbot of Sponheim and later of Würzburg, Trithemius was a prolific writer on ecclesiastical history, biography, and bibliography, but he is best known for his controversial works on magic and secret knowledge. His *Steganographia* (Hidden Writing), which appeared to be a work on angel magic for communicating at a distance, was actually an elaborate cryptographic system concealed within magical language. His *De septem secundeis* (On the Seven Secondary Causes) presented a theory of history based on the governance of planetary angels, each ruling for a period of centuries.</p>
<p>Trithemius's influence on alchemy was indirect but significant. His emphasis on hidden knowledge, his use of cryptographic techniques to conceal information, and his theories about angelic influences on earthly affairs resonated with alchemical traditions of secrecy and cosmic correspondences. His student Agrippa incorporated Trithemian ideas into the *De occulta philosophia*, while Paracelsus may have been influenced by Trithemius's emphasis on divine illumination and hidden wisdom. Trithemius's works on cryptography demonstrated that apparently magical or nonsensical texts could contain hidden rational meanings, a principle that influenced how later readers approached obscure alchemical texts.</p>
<p>Trithemius's reputation was controversial: some admired him as a learned scholar and magus, while others suspected him of practicing forbidden magic. His *Steganographia* was placed on the Index of Forbidden Books, though later scholars recognized its cryptographic nature. Modern scholarship, particularly the work of Noel Brann and others, has examined Trithemius's intellectual project and his influence on Renaissance occultism. Johannes Trithemius thus represents the learned abbot who combined ecclesiastical scholarship with occult studies, and whose emphasis on hidden knowledge and cryptographic concealment influenced how later practitioners understood the relationship between secrecy, magic, and alchemy.</p>
