Maria the Jewess</p>
<p>**Maria the Jewess** (Maria Hebraea, Miriam the Prophetess) is a legendary figure in the history of alchemy, credited in Greco-Egyptian alchemical texts with the invention of important laboratory apparatus and with fundamental alchemical knowledge. Known primarily through citations in the works of Zosimos of Panopolis (late 3rd-early 4th century CE) and other early alchemical writers, Maria is described as an authority on distillation, sublimation, and the construction of alchemical furnaces and vessels. The apparatus attributed to her includes the *tribikos* (a three-armed still for distillation), the *kerotakis* (a device for sublimation and the treatment of metals with vapors), and the water bath or *bain-marie* (named after her in later European tradition), which allowed gentle heating through the use of hot water surrounding the vessel.</p>
<p>The alchemical dicta attributed to Maria in ancient sources are cryptic and symbolic, characteristic of early alchemical writing. Zosimos quotes her as saying "Join the male and the female, and you will find what is sought" and "One becomes two, two becomes three, and by means of the third and fourth achieves unity; thus two are but one." These sayings were interpreted as referring to the combination of alchemical principles, the stages of the work, and the ultimate unity achieved in the Philosopher's Stone. Maria's association with practical apparatus and with fundamental alchemical wisdom made her an important figure in the alchemical tradition, and she was cited by medieval and early modern alchemists as an ancient authority.</p>
<p>The historical reality behind the figure of Maria the Jewess is uncertain. She may have been an actual practitioner whose innovations in apparatus were remembered and attributed to her, or she may be a legendary figure to whom various inventions and sayings were ascribed. The attribution of the *bain-marie* to her in European tradition (the name appears in medieval Latin as *balneum Mariae*) testifies to her lasting influence, even if the connection is etymologically uncertain. Modern scholarship on early alchemy, particularly the work of scholars like Michèle Mertens and Matteo Martelli, has examined the citations of Maria in ancient sources and the apparatus attributed to her, recognizing her importance in the development of alchemical technology. Maria the Jewess thus represents the role of women in early alchemy (whether historical or legendary), the importance of practical innovation in apparatus, and the ways in which alchemical tradition preserved and transmitted the names of its early authorities.</p>
