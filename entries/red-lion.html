Red Lion</p>
<p>**The Red Lion** represents the perfected sulfur, the masculine principle in its most exalted state, and the red Stone itself. The Red Lion appears in alchemical emblems as a fierce lion colored red or gold, often paired with the Green Lion (representing the raw, untamed sulfur or the powerful solvent). While the Green Lion devours the sun, the Red Lion represents the sun perfected, the gold exalted, the sulfur purified and fixed. The Red Lion symbolizes the final stage of the work, the achievement of the red Stone capable of transmuting base metals to gold.</p>
<p>The Red Lion represents the culmination of the work on the sulfuric principle. Through repeated operations of calcination, dissolution, purification, and fixation, the crude sulfur (the Green Lion) is transformed into the perfected sulfur (the Red Lion). This perfected sulfur is the red tincture, the masculine seed that, when united with the purified mercury, generates the Philosopher's Stone. The Red Lion's color represents the rubedo stage, the final reddening that produces the red Stone. The lion's fierce nature represents the power and potency of the perfected sulfur, its ability to transmute and perfect base metals.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, the Red Lion represents the perfected masculine principle, the solar sulfur in its highest state. The transformation from Green Lion to Red Lion symbolizes the taming and perfecting of the raw force of nature, the refinement of the crude into the perfect. The Red Lion is associated with gold, with the sun, with the element of fire, and with the Red King. The Red Lion thus represents both the perfected sulfur that serves as the masculine principle of the Stone and the red Stone itself, the final product of the Great Work capable of transmuting base metals to gold.</p>
