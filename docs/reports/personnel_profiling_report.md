# Report: Personnel Profiling & Biographical Synthesis

**Phase:** 12
**Status:** Initial Seed Complete
**Focus:** Transforming alchemical candidates into structured historical figures.

## Overview
As of the latest Broad Mining pass, we have identified **121 unique entities** with associated mentions. The most prominent figure, **Paracelsus**, appears in 1,621 document chunks, establishing him as the primary semantic anchor of the current library.

## Top Figures by Frequency
Our frequency analysis reveals the "Weight" of specific practitioners in the corpus:
1. **Paracelsus**: 1,621 mentions
2. **Didier Kahn**: 585 mentions (Modern Scholar/Editor)
3. **Michael Maier**: 432 mentions
4. **Robert Boyle**: 360 mentions
5. **John Dee**: 287 mentions

## Synthesis Strategy
For this phase, we have moved beyond simple keyword discovery to **Structured Profiling**. Every biography now includes:
- **Tradition Filtering**: Categorizing figures (e.g., Iatrochemistry vs. Rosicrucianism).
- **Chronological Anchoring**: Detailed lifespans and milestones.
- **Evidence Trails**: Verbatim quotes from the PDFs are pulled into the personnel dossier to verify claims.

## Future Projections
The next steps will involve:
- **Scholar vs. Practitioner Separation**: Automatically distinguishing between contemporary editors (like Didier Kahn) and historical alchemists.
- **Inter-Relational Maps**: Mapping how often Paracelsus is mentioned *alongside* Maier to establish intellectual lineage.
