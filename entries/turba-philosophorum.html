Turba Philosophorum</p>
<p>**The Turba Philosophorum** (Assembly of the Philosophers) is one of the oldest and most influential Latin alchemical texts, probably composed in the twelfth century though claiming to be a translation from Arabic. The work is structured as a gathering of ancient philosophers—including Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato, Aristotle, and others—who debate alchemical principles and processes. Each philosopher presents his views on the nature of matter, the principles of transformation, and the methods of the alchemical work. The *Turba* became a foundational text of Latin alchemy, frequently cited by later alchemists and serving as a source of alchemical theory and practice.</p>
<p>The *Turba* presents alchemy through the voices of multiple authorities, creating a complex and sometimes contradictory text that requires interpretation. The philosophers discuss the nature of the prima materia, the roles of sulfur and mercury, the importance of proper heat and timing, and the stages of the work. The text emphasizes the difficulty and obscurity of alchemy, with the philosophers often speaking in riddles and allegories. The *Turba* introduces many concepts that became central to later alchemy, including the importance of the proper vessel, the role of color changes as signs of progress, and the necessity of repeated operations. The work also presents alchemy as an ancient wisdom tradition passed down from the philosophers of antiquity.</p>
<p>The *Turba*'s significance lies in its role as a foundational text of medieval Latin alchemy. The work established many of the conventions of alchemical writing, including the use of multiple authorities, allegorical language, and the presentation of alchemy as ancient wisdom. The *Turba* was extensively commented upon and cited by later alchemists, who sought to reconcile its various statements and extract practical guidance from its obscure language. The work represents the transmission of alchemical knowledge from Arabic sources into Latin Europe and the development of a distinctively Latin alchemical tradition. The *Turba* demonstrates the textual and interpretive nature of alchemy, where knowledge is transmitted through enigmatic texts that require skilled interpretation.</p>
