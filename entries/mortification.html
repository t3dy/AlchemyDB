Mortification</p>
<p>**Mortification** is the operation of killing or destroying the crude form of matter to prepare it for regeneration in perfected form. In alchemical practice, mortification involved operations that broke down the structure of materials: calcination (burning to ash), putrefaction (allowing to decay), or dissolution (breaking down solid structure). The term derives from Latin *mors* (death), and the operation represented the death of the old form that was necessary before the new, perfected form could be generated. Mortification was associated with the nigredo stage, with blackening, and with the symbolic death of the king or the old Adam.</p>
<p>Mortification could be performed through various methods: calcining materials to destroy their form and reduce them to powder or ash, allowing materials to putrefy and blacken in a sealed vessel, dissolving materials to break down their solid structure, or subjecting materials to corrosive agents that would destroy their form. The key principle was that the old form had to be completely destroyed before the new form could emerge. Partial mortification would not suffice: the matter had to be reduced to the prima materia, the formless chaos from which new creation could begin. The signs of successful mortification included blackening, liquefaction, and the apparent death or corruption of the matter.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, mortification represented the death that precedes resurrection, the destruction that precedes creation, the descent into darkness that precedes the ascent to light. The operation was associated with the death of the king, the crucifixion, the descent into the tomb, and the nigredo stage of the work. Mortification represented the principle that transformation requires the complete destruction of the old form, that new life can only emerge from death, that perfection requires the sacrifice of the imperfect. The operation was associated with Saturn (the dark, leaden planet), with the color black, with the tomb, and with themes of death, sacrifice, and descent. Mortification thus represents both the practical operations of destroying the crude form of matter and the symbolic operation of death and sacrifice necessary for regeneration.</p>
