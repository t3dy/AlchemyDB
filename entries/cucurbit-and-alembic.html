Cucurbit and Alembic</p>
<p>**The cucurbit and alembic** form a two-part distillation apparatus that was fundamental to alchemical practice. The cucurbit (from Arabic *al-qarʿa*, gourd) is a gourd-shaped vessel that holds the material to be distilled, while the alembic (from Arabic *al-anbīq*, still) is a head or cap that fits on top of the cucurbit, with a beak or spout through which distilled vapors exit. When the cucurbit is heated, vapors rise into the alembic, condense on its cooler surfaces, and flow out through the beak into a receiving vessel. This apparatus, inherited from Hellenistic and Islamic alchemy, became the standard distillation equipment in medieval and early modern Europe.</p>
<p>The cucurbit and alembic system allowed for the separation of volatile from fixed components and for the purification of liquids through distillation. Alchemists used this apparatus to prepare spirits (alcohol, acids), to extract essences from plants and minerals, to purify mercury and other substances, and to perform operations related to the Great Work. The apparatus could be made from various materials: glass for visibility and resistance to corrosion, earthenware for economy and heat resistance, or metal (copper, bronze) for durability. The alembic head might be fitted with a "Moor's head" (a rounded cap) or a "blind head" (sealed top) depending on the operation.</p>
<p>Alchemical texts describe numerous variations and refinements of the basic cucurbit-alembic system: multiple alembics stacked for fractional distillation, water-cooled alembics for more efficient condensation, and specialized designs for particular operations. The apparatus appears constantly in alchemical illustrations, often with symbolic significance: the cucurbit might represent the body or the earth, while the alembic represents the head or the heavens, with distillation symbolizing the ascent of spirit and its descent in purified form. The cucurbit and alembic thus represent the fundamental apparatus of alchemical distillation, enabling both practical separations and symbolic transformations.</p>
