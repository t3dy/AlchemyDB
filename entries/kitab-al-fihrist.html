Kitab al-Fihrist</p>
<p>**The Kitab al-Fihrist** (The Catalog) is a tenth-century Arabic bibliographical work by Ibn al-Nadim that provides invaluable information about early Islamic alchemy and the alchemical literature available in tenth-century Baghdad. The *Fihrist* includes a section on alchemy that lists numerous alchemical texts, describes the views of various alchemical authors, and discusses the controversy between those who believed in the possibility of transmutation and those who denied it. The work provides our primary source of information about early Arabic alchemy and the Jabirian corpus, the vast collection of alchemical texts attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan (Geber).</p>
<p>Ibn al-Nadim's section on alchemy describes the major schools of alchemical thought in the Islamic world, including the followers of Jabir, the followers of Razi (Rhazes), and various other alchemists and critics. The *Fihrist* lists hundreds of alchemical titles, many of which are now lost, giving us a sense of the vast scope of early Islamic alchemical literature. Ibn al-Nadim also discusses the philosophical debates about alchemy, including the arguments of those who believed transmutation was possible (based on the Aristotelian theory that all metals share a common matter and differ only in their accidental qualities) and those who denied it (arguing that the essential natures of metals cannot be changed).</p>
<p>The *Fihrist*'s significance lies in its preservation of information about early Islamic alchemy that would otherwise be lost. The work provides evidence for the existence of a sophisticated alchemical tradition in the Islamic world by the tenth century, with extensive literature, philosophical debates, and practical experimentation. The *Fihrist*'s description of the Jabirian corpus has been crucial for modern scholarly understanding of this important body of alchemical texts. The work demonstrates that alchemy was a subject of serious intellectual engagement in the Islamic world, with both practitioners and critics contributing to debates about the nature of matter and the possibility of transmutation.</p>
