# Report: Infrastructure Analysis & Roadmap

## 1. Current State Assessment
Our current infrastructure is built around a **Thematic/Symbolic** model of alchemy. We track "Topics" (Substances, Allegories, Apparatus) and "Practitioners" primarily as biographical entries.

**Successes:**
- Robust registry of 205 documents with AI descriptive summaries.
- Lexicon of 500+ terms linking practitioners to their primary texts.
- Functional relational viewer for entity mentions.

**Gaps:**
- **Flattened Role Logic**: We treat "Alchemist" as a monolithic category, missing the distinction between a *Court Projector* (Becher), an *Artisan* (material focus), and an *Academic Philosopher*.
- **Static Knowledge Types**: Our metadata captures *what* is being talked about, but not the *nature* of the knowledge (e.g., Artisanal vs. Textual vs. Political-Economic).
- **Missing Patronage Layer**: We lack a way to link alchemical projects to the economic and political goals of their patrons (Courts, Princes).

## 2. Infrastructure Roadmap
To reach the level of "The Business of Alchemy" scholarship, we must move from a **Taxonomic** database to a **Sociological** database.

### Phase 16: Relational Expansion
- **Entity De-Monolithing**: Categorizing entities by their socio-economic roles.
- **Alias Graphing**: implementing formal support for pseudonyms and authorship uncertainty (e.g., Starkey ↔ Philalethes).
- **Theory Inheritance**: Tracking the lineage of ideas (e.g., Becher's mineralogy to Stahl's phlogiston).

### Phase 17: Designing for Storytelling
- **Thematic Toggles**: allowing users to switch viewpoints between "Symbolic Alchemist" and "Economic Reformer."
- **Patronage Mapping**: Visualizing the flow of "Alchemical Credit" and status through court networks.
- **Laboratory Provenance**: Linking experimental claims directly to the artisanal material culture described by Smith and Smith.
