Ramon Llull</p>
<p>**Ramon Llull** (c. 1232-1316) was a Catalan philosopher, theologian, and missionary whose ambitious *Ars Magna* (Great Art)—a combinatorial system for discovering truth through the manipulation of fundamental principles—made him one of the most original thinkers of the Middle Ages, and to whom an extensive alchemical literature was falsely attributed in the fourteenth through seventeenth centuries. The historical Llull wrote prolifically on theology, philosophy, and missionary strategy, developing his *Ars* as a universal method for demonstrating Christian truth to Muslims and Jews. There is no evidence that he practiced alchemy or wrote on alchemical subjects; indeed, in his authentic works he occasionally criticized alchemical claims. Nevertheless, beginning in the fourteenth century, numerous alchemical treatises appeared under his name, including the *Testamentum* (Testament), the *Codicillus* (Codicil), and the *Liber de secretis naturae* (Book of Nature's Secrets).</p>
<p>The pseudo-Lullian alchemical corpus became one of the most extensive and influential bodies of alchemical literature, with over 100 works attributed to Llull by the early modern period. These texts presented detailed practical instructions for making the Philosopher's Stone, theoretical discussions of alchemical principles, and claims about Llull's own successful transmutations. Some texts adapted Llull's combinatorial methods to alchemy, creating elaborate diagrams and tables for analyzing and combining alchemical principles. The attribution to Llull gave these texts enormous authority: he was a learned philosopher, a holy man (beatified in the seventeenth century), and a figure whose genuine writings demonstrated systematic thinking and encyclopedic ambition. The pseudo-Lullian texts were widely read, translated, printed, and commented upon, influencing alchemical practice and theory throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Modern scholarship, beginning with the critical work of J. N. Hillgarth and continued by Michela Pereira, William Newman, and others, has thoroughly established the spurious nature of the alchemical corpus and has investigated the processes by which Llull became an alchemical authority. The earliest pseudo-Lullian alchemical texts appear to have been composed in fourteenth-century Italy or southern France, possibly in circles interested in combining Lullian methodology with alchemical practice. The continued production and circulation of these texts through the seventeenth century demonstrates the vitality of the pseudo-Lullian tradition and the ways in which Llull's name and methods could be appropriated for alchemical purposes. Ramon Llull thus represents the most extensive case of posthumous alchemical attribution, and the pseudo-Lullian corpus exemplifies how medieval intellectual authority could be transformed and multiplied through the production of pseudonymous texts.</p>
