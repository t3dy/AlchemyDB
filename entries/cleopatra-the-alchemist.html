Cleopatra the Alchemist</p>
<p>**Cleopatra the Alchemist** is a figure known from Greco-Egyptian alchemical manuscripts, particularly the *Chrysopoeia* (Gold-Making) of Cleopatra, which survives in medieval copies of ancient texts. Not to be confused with the famous Ptolemaic queen, Cleopatra the alchemist is credited with alchemical knowledge and with the creation of important symbolic diagrams, most notably the *Chrysopoeia* diagram depicting the ouroboros (the serpent eating its tail) with the motto "One is All" (ἓν τὸ πᾶν). This image became one of the most iconic symbols of alchemy, representing the unity of matter, the cyclical nature of alchemical processes, and the principle that all things derive from and return to a single source. The *Chrysopoeia* text includes recipes for making gold and silver, descriptions of apparatus, and symbolic imagery combining serpents, vessels, and celestial symbols.</p>
<p>The ouroboros symbol attributed to Cleopatra appeared in various forms in alchemical manuscripts: sometimes as a single serpent, sometimes as two serpents (one dark, one light) representing opposing principles, and often accompanied by symbolic figures and Greek inscriptions. The image was transmitted to medieval and Renaissance Europe through Byzantine manuscript copies and became a central symbol in alchemical iconography, appearing in countless alchemical texts and emblems. The motto "One is All" expressed the fundamental alchemical principle of the unity of matter and the possibility of transformation, while the ouroboros itself symbolized eternity, cyclical processes, and the containment of all things within the alchemical work.</p>
<p>Like Maria the Jewess, Cleopatra the alchemist may have been a historical practitioner whose work was preserved in the alchemical tradition, or she may be a legendary figure to whom texts and symbols were attributed. The *Chrysopoeia* of Cleopatra represents the visual and symbolic dimensions of early alchemy, where diagrams and images conveyed alchemical knowledge alongside textual recipes and instructions. Modern scholarship on Greco-Egyptian alchemy has examined the Cleopatra texts and symbols in their ancient context, recognizing their importance in the development of alchemical symbolism and their transmission to later traditions. Cleopatra the alchemist thus represents the role of women in early alchemy, the power of visual symbols to convey alchemical principles, and the ways in which ancient alchemical knowledge was preserved and transmitted through both text and image.</p>
