Black Crow (Corvus)</p>
<p>**The Black Crow** (corvus) is the symbol of the nigredo stage, the blackening that represents death, putrefaction, and the dissolution of form. The crow appears in alchemical emblems as a black bird, often associated with death, decay, and the tomb. The appearance of blackness in the alchemical matter, called the "crow's head" (caput corvi), was taken as a sign that the putrefaction was proceeding correctly, that the old form was dying and the matter was being reduced to the prima materia from which new life could emerge.</p>
<p>The Black Crow represents the darkest stage of the work, the moment of greatest dissolution and apparent failure. The matter, having been subjected to putrefaction in the sealed vessel, turns black, sometimes liquefies, and appears to be corrupted and dead. This stage was psychologically challenging for the alchemist, as it seemed that the work had failed and the matter was ruined. However, alchemical texts emphasize that the nigredo is necessary and that the appearance of the Black Crow is actually a sign of success: without this death, there can be no resurrection; without this blackening, there can be no whitening.</p>
<p>In alchemical symbolism, the Black Crow represents death, the descent into darkness, the mortification of the old form. The crow, as a carrion bird associated with death and decay, perfectly symbolizes this stage. The blackness represents the absence of light, the state of chaos and formlessness, the return to the prima materia. The Black Crow is often paired with the White Swan or White Dove, which represents the albedo stage that follows the nigredo. The transformation from crow to swan symbolizes the resurrection from death, the emergence of purity from corruption, the whitening that follows the blackening. The Black Crow thus represents both the nigredo stage of the work and the principle that death and dissolution are necessary precursors to regeneration and perfection.</p>
