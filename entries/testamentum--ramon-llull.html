Testamentum (Ramon Llull)</p>
<p>**The Testamentum** and other alchemical works attributed to **Ramon Llull** (c. 1232–1316) represent a significant body of alchemical literature, though modern scholarship has established that these works are pseudonymous, composed by later authors writing under Llull's name. The historical Llull was a Catalan philosopher, theologian, and mystic who developed an elaborate logical and combinatorial system (the Ars Magna), but there is no evidence he practiced or wrote about alchemy. The pseudo-Llullian alchemical corpus, composed in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, applies Llull's combinatorial methods to alchemy, presenting the alchemical work as a systematic art that can be understood through logical analysis.</p>
<p>The pseudo-Llullian alchemical works include the *Testamentum*, the *Codicillus*, the *Liber de Secretis Naturae*, and numerous other treatises. These works present alchemy using Llull's characteristic combinatorial diagrams and logical methods, attempting to systematize alchemical knowledge through the combination of principles, qualities, and operations. The texts discuss the preparation of the Philosopher's Stone, the nature of metallic generation, and the principles of transmutation. The pseudo-Llullian works were widely read and influential, with many alchemists accepting them as genuine works of the famous philosopher and attempting to apply Llullian methods to alchemical practice.</p>
<p>The pseudo-Llullian corpus's significance lies in its attempt to systematize alchemy through logical and combinatorial methods. The works represent the application of scholastic philosophical methods to alchemical theory, treating alchemy as a rational art that can be understood through systematic analysis. The attribution to Llull gave these works considerable authority, as Llull was respected as a philosopher and mystic. The pseudo-Llullian tradition influenced later attempts to systematize alchemy and contributed to the perception of alchemy as a legitimate philosophical discipline. The corpus demonstrates how alchemical authors appropriated the names and methods of respected authorities to lend credibility to their works and to present alchemy as part of the broader philosophical tradition.</p>
