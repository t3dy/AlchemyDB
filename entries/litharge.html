Litharge</p>
<p>**Litharge** (lead monoxide, PbO; Lat. *lithargyrus*, from Greek *lithargyros*, "silver stone") is a yellow or reddish crystalline substance produced as a byproduct of silver refining or by heating lead in air. When silver-bearing lead ores were cupelled (heated in a porous vessel that absorbed the lead oxide while leaving pure silver behind), the absorbed lead oxide could be recovered as litharge—hence its name, which reflects its association with silver production. Litharge was used extensively in glassmaking (as a flux and to produce lead glass), in glazes for pottery, in the preparation of various lead compounds, and in medicine as a desiccant and component of plasters.</p>
<p>In alchemy, litharge was important both as a lead compound and as a reagent in cupellation, the fundamental technique for separating noble from base metals. The *Probierbüchlein* and other assaying manuals describe the use of litharge in testing the purity of gold and silver: the sample was heated with lead or litharge in a cupel, and the base metals were absorbed into the porous cupel while the noble metals remained. This process seemed to demonstrate lead's capacity to "devour" impurities and reveal hidden nobility, making it symbolically significant for alchemical theory. Litharge was also used in the preparation of various lead salts and in attempts to "open" or "mortify" lead for transmutational operations.</p>
<p>Modern chemistry understands litharge as lead(II) oxide, which exists in two crystalline forms (yellow orthorhombic and red tetragonal). The substance is indeed an effective flux, lowering the melting point of silicates and facilitating the fusion of glass and glazes. Its role in cupellation is genuine: lead oxide is absorbed into the porous cupel (made of bone ash or other absorbent material), carrying away base metals as their oxides while noble metals (which resist oxidation) remain. The toxicity of litharge, like that of all lead compounds, made it dangerous to handle and use, though this was not fully appreciated in the pre-modern period. The substance's dual role—as an industrial material in glassmaking and pottery, and as an alchemical reagent in assaying and transmutation attempts—exemplifies how practical chemical knowledge and alchemical theory informed each other in the development of early modern chemistry.</p>
