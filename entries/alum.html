Alum</p>
<p>**Alum** (potassium aluminum sulfate, KAl(SO₄)₂·12H₂O; Lat. *alumen*) is a white crystalline salt that was one of the most important industrial chemicals of the medieval and early modern periods, used extensively in dyeing, tanning, medicine, and alchemy. The term "alum" was applied to various astringent salts, but the most prized variety was potash alum, mined in Asia Minor (particularly at Phocaea) and later produced in Italy (at Tolfa, in the Papal States). Alum's primary use was as a mordant in textile dyeing—it fixed dyes to fibers, making colors brighter and more permanent—but it also served as an astringent in medicine, a preservative for hides in tanning, and a component in various alchemical preparations. The alum trade was economically and politically significant: the papal monopoly on Tolfa alum in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries generated enormous revenues for the Vatican.</p>
<p>In alchemy, alum was used in the preparation of mineral acids (particularly sulfuric acid, distilled from alum or vitriol), in the purification of metals, and in various attempts to color or transmute metals. The *Mappae Clavicula* and other medieval technical texts describe recipes using alum to whiten copper, to prepare gold-colored alloys, and to create artificial gems. Alum's astringent properties—its ability to precipitate proteins and coagulate organic materials—made it useful in clarifying liquids and in various pharmaceutical preparations. The "burnt alum" or "calcined alum" produced by heating alum to drive off its water of crystallization was used as a desiccant and as a component in certain alchemical operations.</p>
<p>Modern chemistry understands alum as a double sulfate containing aluminum and potassium (or other alkali metals), and recognizes its astringent properties as resulting from the aluminum ion's ability to denature proteins and precipitate organic matter. The medieval and early modern alum industry represented a sophisticated chemical enterprise, involving mining, purification through crystallization, and quality control. William Newman's research has shown how alchemical knowledge of salts and crystallization informed industrial practices, while Pamela Smith's work has revealed how artisanal expertise with alum shaped both craft traditions and natural philosophical understanding. Alum thus exemplifies how a single substance could be simultaneously an industrial commodity, a pharmaceutical agent, a craftsman's tool, and an alchemical reagent, bridging economic, medical, and experimental domains.</p>
