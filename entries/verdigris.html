Verdigris</p>
<p>**Verdigris** (basic copper acetate, Cu(CH₃COO)₂·Cu(OH)₂; Lat. *viride aeris*, "green of copper") is the green patina that forms on copper and bronze when exposed to acetic acid (vinegar) and air, used extensively as a pigment, mordant, and medicinal substance. The preparation of verdigris was described in numerous medieval and early modern texts: copper plates were suspended over vinegar in sealed vessels, and the green crust that formed was scraped off, collected, and purified. The resulting substance ranged from blue-green to deep green depending on its exact composition and purity. Verdigris was one of the most important green pigments in medieval and Renaissance painting, prized for its brilliant color despite its tendency to darken or discolor over time when mixed with certain other pigments or exposed to sulfur compounds.</p>
<p>In alchemy and medicine, verdigris was used as a component in various preparations. Its corrosive properties made it useful for "opening" or "mortifying" metals in alchemical operations, and it was employed in attempts to color or transmute copper. In medicine, verdigris was used externally as a caustic to remove warts and proud flesh, and (more controversially) internally in very small doses as an emetic and purgative. The *Mappae Clavicula* and other technical texts describe recipes for preparing different grades of verdigris and for using it in various crafts, including dyeing, painting, and metalworking. The substance's vivid green color associated it symbolically with Venus (copper's planetary correspondence) and with the "greening" or vivification of matter.</p>
<p>Modern chemistry understands verdigris as a mixture of basic copper acetates and copper carbonates, formed through the reaction of copper with acetic acid and carbon dioxide in the presence of moisture. The substance is indeed toxic, as copper compounds generally are, explaining both its medicinal effects (as an irritant and emetic) and the health problems experienced by painters and craftsmen who worked with it extensively. Pamela Smith's research on artisanal knowledge has revealed the sophistication of verdigris production and use, showing how craftsmen developed empirical understanding of factors affecting color, purity, and stability. The substance exemplifies how alchemical and artisanal knowledge overlapped: the same material served as a painter's pigment, a dyer's mordant, a physician's caustic, and an alchemist's reagent, with expertise flowing between these different domains of practice.</p>
